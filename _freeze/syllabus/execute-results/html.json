For lab help, make an appointment with Diana Gao by email \n\n## Learning Objectives:\n\nUpon successfully completing this course, students will be able to:\n\n1.  Understand the basic principles of animal physiology, and discuss issues such as how animals remain in homeostasis in the face of changing internal or external environments, the role of fluxes and the expenditures of energy against them, and the various solutions that vertebrate lineages have evolved to meet life’s challenges. \n2.  Be able to apply these principles to novel situations. \n3.  Be able to write a well-researched and reasoned scientific paper.\n4.  Be able to design and perform basic laboratory experiments in comparative physiology.\n5.  Understand that science is advanced by the creative application of past knowledge to new situations to generate new knowledge, and the importance of collaboration in a diverse scientific community.\n\n## Course Objectives:\n1.  Teach basic principles of animal physiology, \n2.  Practice the scientific method and strengthen critical thinking skills and active, self-directed learning by putting into practice the scientific method, \n3.  Engender good laboratory skills and approaches to physiological experimentation, \n4.  Develop scientific writing and speaking skills, \n5.  Promote proficiency in reading primary scientific literature and improve ability to find that literature, \n6.  Promote skills necessary to engage in productive intellectual interactions and successful collaboration.\n\n## Course Methods:\nWe will learn science by practicing science.  \n\nStudents will learn through assigned __readings__, will come to class prepared for productive __discussion__, practice scientific problem-solving by completing __homeworks__, and engage in __project-based learning__. Labs will reinforce learning through __experimentation__ and writing __lab reports__. \n\nAs this is a writing and oral intensive course, we will learn by reviewing, editing, and rewriting your work as well as develop of effective scientific arguments through oral presentation.  Attendance is mandatory. \n\n\n\n## Textbook \n\n:::{.callout-note}\n__REQUIRED TEXT__: _Comparative Animal Physiology_ by Phillip C.

Each personʻs discussion grade is averaged from their partners.  _Failure to attend = zero grade discussion grade._ Teaching staff can override grades for poor contribution at our discretion.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## _Successful discussion requires a respectful attitude and collaborative behavior._ \n- [_Participation means Everyone must speak; everyone must listen_]{style=\"color: blue\"} \n    + Take turns before diving deeper\n    + Listen before contributing again\n    + Take the time to make everyone feel comfortable\n- Encourage participation from all — if someone is quiet, ___ask___ for their input/thoughts\n- Respect cultural differences, do not judge people based on communication style\n- Discussions are not about “scoring points” — they are about going deeper and getting creative. \n:::\n\n## Problem Sets\n\nProblem sets (homework) are designed to help you _master_ the lecture material AND to _prepare for the modeling calculations you will have to do in your animal design projects_. Problem sets are posted online and due in one week at the start of lecture.  \n- __Everyone must do their own work__\n- __Homeworks must be hand-written by yourself. Draw pictures by hand. On paper or by tablet is OK.__\n- Come for help if you are stuck. \n- You may collaborate by working together — you may discuss strategies for solving the problems. [DO NOT ASK FOR OR GIVE OUT THE WORKED OUT ANSWER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.]{style=\"color: blue\"} \n- Cheating or abuse of the honor system will result in big changes in the course and reporting to the Office of Judicial Affairs.\n\n## Animal Design Project\nThe major project of this course. Work in a team of two to design four physiological systems of an extinct vertebrate animal: metabolism, digestion, respiration, and excretion (or your original design). \n\nYou will collect background information to inform your physiological model, and puzzle out how your animal could have solved its physiological challenges. Papers, peer and instructor reviews, and opportunity to revise. More details on last page of syllabus under “Animal Design Project.” Make 2 oral presentations.\n\n### Information Sources\n-  Your instructors, textbooks, books on organismal biology and paleontology in Hamilton Library, and the Internet are good places to start.  \n-  References cited in your paper should be from the PRIMARY SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE (i.e., __scientific books, review articles, and primary research articles from peer-reviewed professional scientific journals__). Books and journals for the general public are not acceptable. \n-  Use of websites are discouraged, only those maintained by research institutions (e.g., scientific museums) may be used. \n-  Caution!: DO NOT CITE CREATIONIST or POPULAR websites. Careful -- creationists create \"institutes\" too. \n-  Good websites for exploring potential fossils: \n    +  Tree of Life Project: <http://www.tolweb.org/tree/>\n    +  Recent issues of [Nature](https://uhawaii-manoa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma9951085563805682&context=L&vid=01UHAWAII_MANOA:MANOA&lang=en&search_scope=DN_and_CI&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=Everything&query=any,contains,nature) (especially) or [Science]().

Please reach out to him for help - heʻs very friendly and willing to help.\n:::\n\n\n## Oral Presentations\n\nYou will present two 10 minute __oral presentations__ on your animal design: in week 5 during the lab session, and at the end of the semester in the lecture. Scientific talks are for receiving feedback on work in progress from the scientific community before their paper is finalized, so you are encouraged to speak on work in progress.\n\n## No Exams in this class\nNo one makes a living taking tests.\n\n## Guidelines for Group Work\n\nLearning how to collaborate is an important life skill in today's world, but it is hard. [The point of collaboration is to produce of higher quality than what we can accomplish alone.]{style=\"color: blue\"}\n\n:::{.callout-tip} \n# Successful partners:\n- Share a vision regarding the quality of work produced. \n- Have a clear plan of action _developed collaboratively_. \n- Stick to agreed schedule. \n- Will meet face to face or by zoom, etc.\n- Share work equitably.\n- Respect each other and their contributions. Are honest. \n- Communicate: Keep partners updated at all times.\n- Complete work early enough to check each other's work and edit before handing it in.\n- DO NOT partner with your best friend, girlfriend, boyfriend, etc.  __Bad idea.__ \n- __Most, most, most important: Good partners do what they agreed to and get the job done on time.__  \n\n[_Outstanding papers will be a unified product of both partners contributing their best efforts._]{style=\"color: blue\"}\n:::\n\nWe will see a wide range of papers in this class –  from what looks like last-minute work, to those that rise to the level of professional-quality. It is an amazing difference. \n\n## Tech-Related Course Policies and Expectations\n\n- [_You are expected to do your own work:_]{style=\"color: blue\"} reading assignments, research, and homeworks. \n- [_You are responsible for all of your work._]{style=\"color: blue\"} If your name appears on the work, you are an author and are responsible for the work. _Make sure you approve everything that is turned in on your behalf_.\n- _Any work submitted as your own must include proper crediting of all sources used._ This includes communication through any form of media, for example: in class, on the course website, or posted on Facebook. Do not “cut and paste” from text on posts or assignments without proper citation — this is cheating. \n- _Please do not multi-task during class._ This means no email, text, DM, social media, off-line conversations, sports scores, video games, etc. during class. _We can see you._ Laptops and mobile devices are allowed only for in-class activities. Abuse of devices may result in requiring devices to be turned in or being asked to leave the room.  \n- You are required to use computers and the internet as part of this course. Technical difficulties are no excuse for unfinished work, there are computers in the library. If you have any issues please see me for help, UH has laptops for loan.\n- _All assignments and postings are due on the dates indicated_ so that the class can proceed smoothly. Grading and feedback will be given within two weeks of submission date. \n\n# LABORATORY:\n\n## Laboratory Sessions\nLabs meet once per week starting immediately. There will be [12 sessions](schedule.qmd) when experiments will be performed, one session for discussion of critiques of your animal design projects, and one session mid-semester when each team will deliver a 10-minute oral report on your animal design project.\n\n## Laboratory Attendance\n[__Attendance is mandatory and there are no make-up labs.__]{style=\"color: blue\"} Failure to attend a lab will result in a grade of “zero” for that laboratory report unless you were absent due to health problems and have documentation from a doctor, clinic, or coroner stating why you were unable to attend class.  \n\nIf you are a UH athlete and are going to miss a laboratory due to an athletic event, you must inform your TA and Dr. Butler AT LEAST TWO WEEKS before that date.  In the case of acceptable absences, arrangements for alternate assignments will be made, as appropriate, and if feasible.\n\n## Laboratory Materials\n- Bound __laboratory notebook__ (composition book is fine)\n closed-toed shoes for labs involving dissection.  \n- __Software:__ Install a free copy (reader version) of the data acquisition software to work on data analysis at home. Labchart 7.x or 8.x Reader:  <http://www.adinstruments.com/support/software>\n- If you have a __dissection kit__, please bring it to dissection labs. \n\n## Pre-Lab\nPrior to lab\n\n1. Read the __lab manual__ and any __protocols__ with the aim of understanding the main question and techniques used, \n2. Do the prelab __quiz__ on Laulima, and \n3. Come with a completed __prelab__ written in your notebook, consisting of: __a brief introduction and a materials and methods section.__ Easy points! But no credit for late Pre-Labs.\n\n## Laboratory Roles \nLaboratories will be conducted in groups of 3, with roles which rotate each week: \n\n1. __The animal handler/test subject__, who preps the subject, performs any dissection, and maintains the prep in good condition throughout the experiment \n2. __The experimenter__, responsible for all aspects of experimental setup and performing the manipulations, and scribe duties, and \n3. __The computer recorder__, who ensures that all data are recorded with annotations, and makes sure that the data are saved and distributed to all members. \n4. One of you will also be the __project coordinator__, which also rotates weekly\n\n### Project Coordinator\nThe __project coordinator__ ensures that everyone knows their roles, works together efficiently and harmoniously, and checks data quality before moving on to the next procedure. They also  collaboratively establish writing assignments and deadlines. Like the producer on a movie set, the project coordinator is responsible for making everyone is doing their part to accomplishing the tasks. _Note: The PC does NOT do all of the analysis or writing._\n\n_Each PC earns a “project coordinator score” based on the average score of the group lab reports for which he/she was project coordinator._\n\n## Laboratory Reports\nThere will be a total of 12 laboratory reports: \n\n- 9 group reports (G), \n- 3 individual worksheets (IWS), and \n- 1 individual report (I; see [calendar](schedule.qmd)).\n\nLab reports should be 3-5 pages in length; focus on the main ideas and get straight to the point. You can go longer if you can’t be more concise (donʻt just stop). Scientific content matters much more than style. \n\n## Fair Contributions to Group Work\n\n- Group reports will be submitted by the Project Coordinator but __must have substantial contributions from each member of the group__.  \n- Each collaborative report must have an official __“statement of respective contributions”__ section at the end of the report, detailing members contributions.\n- Each group report submission will be followed by a __\"Lab Partner Evaluation\"__ which you will be invited to complete by an email from TEAMMATES. These are used to calculate your participation grade. \n- Please be honest and accountable, this is the path to improvement and success. \n\n## Software\n\n__LabChart Reader Software:__ Install a free copy (reader version) of the data acquisition software to work on data analysis at home. Labchart 7.x or 8.x Reader:  <http://www.adinstruments.com/support/software>\n\nSpreadsheet software is helpful for analyzing data and creating figures. __google sheets__, __excel__, __numbers__, or __LibreOffice__ are fine. \n\n[Optional] If you use R, let me know, and I can help. [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org).\n\n### Project collaboration\n\nPlease feel free to study together and talk to one another about project assignments. The mutual instruction that students give each other is among the most valuable that can be achieved.\n\nHowever, it is expected that **project assignments will be implemented and written up independently unless otherwise specified**. Specifically, please share strategies but not solutions, especially with folks who have not tried it yet themselves. \n\nPlease __do collaborate__ on write-up and interpretation with your actual design partners or lab partners. Include all partners on all communications with instructional staff. \n\n## Discussion Forum\n\nThe course will make use of DISCORD to ask and answer questions and discuss any of the course materials. Please engage and provide answers as well as questions. The Instructor will monitor DISCORD and answer questions when appropriate.\n\n## Exams\n\nThere are **no exams** in this course.\n\n## Grading\n\nThere will be a lot of points available for you to earn in the course.  As shown in the table below ~1/3 your grade will be based on points from lecture-based problem sets and discussions, ~1/3 from laboratory reports, and ~1/3 from the animal design project and oral presentation assignments.\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n|   Category    |   N   |   Points Each |   Total Points    |\n|   ----    |   ----    |   ----    |   ----    |\n|   Lab Work Sheets - Individual    |   3   |   20  |   60  |\n|   Laboratory Reports - Group  |   8   |   30  |   240 |\n|   Laboratory Reports – Individual |   1   |   60  |   60  |\n|   Laboratory Project Coordinator  |   1   |   30  |   30  |\n|   Laboratory Partner Evaluation   |   8   |   10  |   80  |\n|   Pre-Lab Quiz    |   10  |   5   |   50  |\n|   Pre-Lab |   10  |   5   |   50  |\n|   Lecture Problem Sets    |   6   |   30  |   180 |\n|   Discussion Partner Evaluation   |   15  |   10  |   150 |\n|   Quizzes |   ?   |   ?   |       |\n|   Design Background   |   1   |   10  |   10  |\n|   Design Project – first author   |   2   |   105 |   210 |\n|   Design Project – second author  |   2   |   45  |   90  |\n|    Design Projects – partner evaluation   |   4   |   15  |   60  |\n|   Peer Review |   3   |   10  |   30  |\n|   Oral Presentations  |   2   |   50  |   100 |\n|   TOTAL   |       |       |   1400    |\n\n: Assignment Values {#tbl-points tbl-colwidths=\"[40,5,10,10]\"}\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"5%\"}\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"25%\"}\n\n\n|   Grading Scale   |       |\n|   ----    |   ----    |\n|   Points  |   Grade   |\n|   92-100% |   A   |\n|   90-91.9%    |   A-  |\n|   87-89.9%    |   B+  |\n|   82-86.9%    |   B   |\n|   80-81.9%    |   B-  |\n|   77-79.9%    |   C+  |\n|   72-76.9%    |   C   |\n|   69-71.9%    |   C-  |\n|   67-68.9%    |   D+  |\n|   62-66.9%    |   D   |\n|   55-61.9%    |   D-  |\n|   below 55%   |   F   |\n\n: Grade Scale {#tbl-gradescale tbl-colwidths=\"[20,10]\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n- You will receive the same grade for both 430 and 430L (they are reciprocal co-requisites). Your scores will be rounded to the nearest 0.1%. \n- You must be passing (D- or higher) both the lab and lecture to get an overall passing grade.\n- NOTE: __Effort counts!__ If you are on the border, I will use the effort you demonstrate through your work to decide whether to push you over. \n- __Turn in ALL of your work,__ even if it is really late. [It shows effort]{style=\"color: blue\"}. \n:::\n\n## Policy for late work\n\nThe policy for late submissions is as follows:\n\n- Each student will be given two free \"late days\" for the rest of the course.\n- A late day extends the individual project deadline by 24 hours without penalty.\n- The late days can be applied to just one project (e.g. two late days for Project 2), or they can be split across the two projects (one late day for Project 2 and one late day for Project 3). This is entirely left up to the discretion of the student.\n- Late days are intended to give you flexibility: you can use them for any reason no questions asked.\n- You do not get any bonus points for not using your late days, and they are not transferrable.\n\nFor students who exceed their free late days:\n\n- I will be deducting 5% for each extra late day. For example, if you have already used all of your late days for the term, we will deduct 5% for the assignment that is <24 hours late, 10% points for the assignment that is 24-48 hours late, and 15% points for the assignment that is 48-72 hours late, etc.\n- **I will not grade assignments that are more than 3 days past the original due date**.\n\n### Regrading Policy\n\nIt is very important to me that all assignments are properly graded. If you believe there is an error in your assignment grading, please send an email within 7 days of receiving the grade explaining the issue. No re-grade requests will be accepted orally, and no regrade requests will be accepted more than 7 days after you receive the grade for the assignment.\n\n\n## Academic Ethics and Student Conduct Code\n\nThe faculty, staff, and students participating in courses of the School of Life Sciences assume a responsibility to uphold the Universityʻs missions of academic excellence and social responsibility as appropriate for an institute of higher education. Violations of the UH Systemwide Student Conduct Code includes but is not limited to: cheating; plagiarism; providing copies of your work to other students which is submitted as their own; obtaining copies of said work by others; using copies of said work or representing any portion of another person’s work as your own (i.e., plagiarism); misconduct. While we encourage you to discuss strategies for problem solving,  and even collaborate by working through the problems/strategies together, giving someone all the answers is cheating. If you are unsure please ask.\n\nPlagiarism is when you use information or present ideas, whether by paraphrase or direct quote, from a source (be it published or a classmate) without giving proper credit to that source.\nCheating in any way will be reported to the attention of UH Office of Judicial Affairs, and result in an F in this course.\nStudents should be familiar with the policies and procedures specified under the Systemwide Student Conduct Code [portal](http://studentaffairs.manoa.hawaii.edu/policies/conduct_code/proscribed_conduct.php).\n\n\n## Disability Support Service\n\nStudents requiring accommodations for disabilities should register with [the Kokua program at Student Disability Services](https://www.hawaii.edu/kokua/). It is the responsibility of the student to register for accommodations. The Kokua office will send me a notification once you are registered, however, they often do not share information regarding the specifics. If the accommodations are not sufficient to ensure your success, please contact me as soon as possible so that we may work together on providing for an effective learning environment.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThis is an applied quantitative course. I will not discuss the mathematical details of specific data analysis approaches, however some statistical background and being comfortable with quantitative thinking is useful. Previous experience with writing computer programs in general and R in particular is also helpful, but not necessary. If you have no programming experience, expect to spend extra time getting yourself familiar with R. As long as you are willing to invest the time to learn the programming and you do not mind thinking quantitatively, you should be able to take the course, independent of your background.\n\n### Getting set up\n\nYou must install [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) on your computer in order to complete this course. These are two **different** applications that must be installed separately before they can be used together:\n\n-   R is the core underlying programming language and computing engine that we will be learning in this course\n\n-   RStudio is an interface into R that makes many aspects of using and programming R simpler\n\nBoth R and RStudio are available for Windows, macOS, and most flavors of Unix and Linux. Please download the version that is suitable for your computing setup.\n\nThroughout the course, we will make use of numerous R add-on packages that must be installed over the Internet. Packages can be installed using the `install.packages()` function in R. For example, to install the `tidyverse` package, you can run\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nin the R console.\n\n#### How to Download R for Windows\n\nGo to [https://cran.r-project.org]() and\n\n1.

Understand the basic principles of animal physiology, and discuss issues such as how animals remain in homeostasis in the face of changing internal or external environments, the role of fluxes and the expenditures of energy against them, and the various solutions that vertebrate lineages have evolved to meet life’s challenges. \n2.  Be able to apply these principles to novel situations. \n3.  Be able to write a well-researched and reasoned scientific paper.\n4.  Be able to design and perform basic laboratory experiments in comparative physiology.\n5.  Understand that science is advanced by the creative application of past knowledge to new situations to generate new knowledge, and the importance of collaboration in a diverse scientific community.\n\n## Course Objectives:\n1.  Teach basic principles of animal physiology, \n2.  Practice the scientific method and strengthen critical thinking skills and active, self-directed learning by putting into practice the scientific method, \n3.  Engender good laboratory skills and approaches to physiological experimentation, \n4.  Develop scientific writing and speaking skills, \n5.  Promote proficiency in reading primary scientific literature and improve ability to find that literature, \n6.  Promote skills necessary to engage in productive intellectual interactions and successful collaboration.\n\n## Course Methods:\nWe will learn science by practicing science.  \n\nStudents will learn through assigned __readings__, will come to class prepared for productive __discussion__, practice scientific problem-solving by completing __homeworks__, and engage in __project-based learning__. Labs will reinforce learning through __experimentation__ and writing __lab reports__. \n\nAs this is a writing and oral intensive course, we will learn by reviewing, editing, and rewriting your work as well as develop of effective scientific arguments through oral presentation.  Attendance is mandatory. \n\n\n## Lectures\n\nIn Fall 2023, we will have in person lectures. If requested, I will attempt to record them and post to the website.\n\n## Textbook and Other Course Material\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n__REQUIRED TEXT__: _Comparative Animal Physiology_ by Phillip C. Withers, 1992.  \n- Rent your copy from the Biology Office St. John 101 ($20 deposit, refundable when book is returned) . \n- If you want to purchase your own copy, order online and use [_EXPEDITED SHIPPING_]{style=\"color: blue\"} or your book may take 4-6 weeks to arrive!\n    + Google \"Comparative Animal Physiology Withers\" or [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Comparative-Animal-Physiology-Philip-Withers/dp/0030128471/ref=sr_1_1?crid=27H1FXPKWUZOC&keywords=comparative+animal+physiology&qid=1692490538&sprefix=comparative+animal+physiology%2Caps%2C339&sr=8-1) or [alibris.com](https://www.alibris.com/booksearch?mtype=B&keyword=comparative+animal+physiology&hs.x=0&hs.y=0) etc. (or try google books “see all sellers” ).  \n:::\n\nOPTIONAL: [Animal Physiology](https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/animal-physiology-9780197552438?q=hill%20wise%20anderson&cc=us&lang=en) by Hill, Wyse, and Anderson. Looseleaf or ebook is also available. \n-  Get a used book or older edition if you’d like to save money (via Expedited Shipping!) or any upper-level comparative or human physiology book.\nLab Manual will be posted on website. \n\n__Course Website:__ <https://mbutler808.github.io/animalphys/> Information central for both the lecture and laboratory. Posted here are all assignments, including reading assignments, problem sets, laboratory exercises and reports.  \n\n[Google Drive]() Where we will post additional resources. I will add you to the drive using your UH ID.  If you want to use an alternative email LMK: [email](mailto:mbutler808@gmail.com).   \n\n[Laulima](https://laulima.hawaii.edu/) For grades and lab quizzes.     \n\n# Course Mechanics\n\n## Scaffolding\n\n- Readings prepare you for discussion\n- Discussion is for trying out your ideas for homework and projects\n- Homework is practice for the design projects\n- Oral presentations are for developing arguments for design projects\n- Peer review provides feedback on design drafts\n- Synthesize all your feedback into design projects\n\n## Discussion\n\n__Class time__ is mainly for interacting with the content through __discussion__. \n_Discussion is important for brainstorming and testing your explanations and getting feedback prior to your homework and design projects._ Read, ponder the study questions, and come to class prepared to engage in a high-level discussion in your discussion group of 3, assigned at random each week. \n\n__Grading__: Each week you will evaluate your discussion partners  (based on quality of contributions, preparation, participation). Each personʻs discussion grade is averaged from their partners.  _Failure to attend = zero grade discussion grade._ Teaching staff can override grades for poor contribution at our discretion.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## _Successful discussion requires a respectful attitude and collaborative behavior._ \n- [_Participation means Everyone must speak; everyone must listen_]{style=\"color: blue\"} \n    + Take turns before diving deeper\n    + Listen before contributing again\n    + Take the time to make everyone feel comfortable\n- Encourage participation from all — if someone is quiet, ___ask___ for their input/thoughts\n- Respect cultural differences, do not judge people based on communication style\n- Discussions are not about “scoring points” — they are about going deeper and getting creative. \n:::\n\n## Problem Sets\n\nProblem sets are designed to help you _master_ the lecture material AND to _prepare for the modeling calculations you will have to do in your animal design projects_. Problem sets are posted online and due in one week at the start of lecture.  \n- __Everyone must do their own work__\n- __Homeworks must be hand-written by yourself. Draw pictures by hand. On paper or by tablet is OK.__\n- Come for help if you are stuck. \n- You may collaborate by working together — you may discuss strategies for solving the problems. [DO NOT ASK FOR OR GIVE OUT THE WORKED OUT ANSWER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.]{style=\"color: blue\"} \n- Cheating or abuse of the honor system will result in big changes in the course and reporting to the Office of Judicial Affairs.\n\n## Animal Design Project\nThe major project of this course. Work in a team of two to design four physiological systems of an extinct vertebrate animal: metabolism, digestion, respiration, and excretion (or your original design). \n\nYou will collect background information to inform your physiological model, and puzzle out how your animal could have solved its physiological challenges. Papers, peer and instructor reviews, and opportunity to revise. More details on last page of syllabus under “Animal Design Project.” Make 2 oral presentations.\n\n### Information Sources\n-  Your instructors, textbooks, books on organismal biology and paleontology in Hamilton Library, and the Internet are good places to start.  \n-  References cited in your paper should be from the PRIMARY SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE (i.e., __scientific books, review articles, and primary research articles from peer-reviewed professional scientific journals__). Books and journals for the general public are not acceptable. \n-  Use of websites are discouraged, only those maintained by research institutions (e.g., scientific museums) may be used. \n-  Caution!: DO NOT CITE CREATIONIST or POPULAR websites. Careful -- creationists create \"institutes\" too. \n-  Good websites for exploring potential fossils: \n    +  Tree of Life Project: <http://www.tolweb.org/tree/>\n    +  Recent issues of [Nature](https://uhawaii-manoa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma9951085563805682&context=L&vid=01UHAWAII_MANOA:MANOA&lang=en&search_scope=DN_and_CI&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=Everything&query=any,contains,nature) (especially) or [Science]().

Please reach out to him for help - heʻs very friendly and willing to help.\n:::\n\n\n\nOral Presentations\nYou will present two 10 minute oral presentations on your animal design: in week 8 during the lab session, and at the end of the semester in the lecture. Scientific talks are for receiving feedback on work in progress from the scientific community before their paper is finalized, so you are encouraged to speak on work in progress.\nNo Exams in this class. No one makes a living taking tests.\nGuidelines for Group Work\nLearning how to collaborate is an important life skill in today's world, but it is hard. The point of collaboration is to produce of higher quality than what we can accomplish alone. \nSuccessful partners:\nShare a vision regarding the quality of work produced. \nHave a clear plan of action. Stick to agreed schedule. Will meet face to face or by phone, etc.\nShare work equitably.\nRespect each other and their contributions. Are honest. \nCommunicate: Keep partners updated at all times.\nComplete work early enough to check each other's work and edit before handing it in.\nDO NOT partner with your best friend, girlfriend, boyfriend, etc.  Bad idea. \nMost, most, most important: Good partners do what they agreed to and get the job done on time.\nOutstanding papers will be a unified product of both partners contributing their best efforts. We will see a wide range of papers in this class –  from what looks like last-minute work, to those that rise to the level of professional-quality. It is an amazing difference. \n\n\n## Software\n\nPlease install R onto your laptop. You can obtain R from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org). There are versions available for Mac, Windows, and Unix/Linux. This software is **required** for this course.\n\nIt is important that you have the latest version of R installed. For this course we will be using **R version 4.2.1** or higher. You can determine what version of R you have by starting up R and typing into the console `R.version.string` and hitting the `return`/`enter` key. If you do not have the proper version of R installed, go to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) and download and install the latest version.\n\nSome students like to use the Rstudio interface, but this is optional. The RStudio interactive development environment (IDE) requires that R be installed, and so is an \"add-on\" to R. You can obtain the RStudio Desktop for free from the [RStudio web site](https://www.rstudio.com/). You can determine the version of RStudio by looking at menu item `Help > About RStudio`. You should be using **RStudio version 1.4.1106 or higher**.\n\n## Quizzes\n\nThere will be weekly (short) quizzes on Laulima. These are intended to be low-stakes to assist you in checking your understanding.\n\n## Projects\n\nThere will be one optional assignment and 4 graded assignments, due every 2--3 weeks. Projects will be submitted electronically via GitHub (more on this later).\n\nThe project assignments will be due on\n\n-   Project 0: February 3, 11:59pm (optional and not graded but hopefully useful and fun)\n-   Project 1: February 17, 11:59pm\n-   Project 2: March 10, 11:59pm\n-   Project 3: April 7, 11:59pm\n-   Project 4: May 5, 11:59pm\n\n### Project collaboration\n\nPlease feel free to study together and talk to one another about project assignments. The mutual instruction that students give each other is among the most valuable that can be achieved.\n\nHowever, it is expected that **project assignments will be implemented and written up independently unless otherwise specified**. Specifically, please do not share analytic code or output. Please do not collaborate on write-up and interpretation. Please do not access or use solutions from any source before your project assignment is submitted for grading.\n\n## Discussion Forum\n\nThe course will make use of SLACK to ask and answer questions and discuss any of the course materials. Please engage and provide answers as well as questions. The Instructor will monitor SLACK and answer questions when appropriate.\n\n## Exams\n\nThere are **no exams** in this course.\n\n## Grading\n\nGrades in the course will be based on weekly quizzes (20%), participation (10%) and projects (70%). Each of Projects 1--3 counts approximately equally in the final grade. Grades will be posted on Laulima.\n\n## Policy for submitted projects late\n\nThe policy for late submissions is as follows:\n\n- Each student will be given two free \"late days\" for the rest of the course.\n- A late day extends the individual project deadline by 24 hours without penalty.\n- The late days can be applied to just one project (e.g. two late days for Project 2), or they can be split across the two projects (one late day for Project 2 and one late day for Project 3). This is entirely left up to the discretion of the student.\n- Late days are intended to give you flexibility: you can use them for any reason no questions asked.\n- You do not get any bonus points for not using your late days, and they are not transferrable.\n\nFor students who exceed their free late days:\n\n- I will be deducting 5% for each extra late day. For example, if you have already used all of your late days for the term, we will deduct 5% for the assignment that is <24 hours late, 10% points for the assignment that is 24-48 hours late, and 15% points for the assignment that is 48-72 hours late, etc.\n- **I will not grade assignments that are more than 3 days past the original due date**.\n\n### Regrading Policy\n\nIt is very important to me that all assignments are properly graded. If you believe there is an error in your assignment grading, please send an email within 7 days of receiving the grade explaining the issue. No re-grade requests will be accepted orally, and no regrade requests will be accepted more than 7 days after you receive the grade for the assignment.\n\n\n## Academic Ethics and Student Conduct Code\n\nThe faculty, staff, and students participating in courses of the School of Life Sciences assume a responsibility to uphold the Universityʻs missions of academic excellence and social responsibility as appropriate for an institute of higher education. Violations of the UH Systemwide Student Conduct Code includes but is not limited to: cheating; plagiarism; providing copies of your work to other students which is submitted as their own; obtaining copies of said work by others; using copies of said work or representing any portion of another person’s work as your own (i.e., plagiarism); misconduct. While we encourage you to discuss strategies for problem solving,  and even collaborate by working through the problems/strategies together, giving someone all the answers is cheating. If you are unsure please ask.\n\nPlagiarism is when you use information or present ideas, whether by paraphrase or direct quote, from a source (be it published or a classmate) without giving proper credit to that source.\nCheating in any way will be reported to the attention of UH Office of Judicial Affairs, and result in an F in this course.\nStudents should be familiar with the policies and procedures specified under the Systemwide Student Conduct Code [portal](http://studentaffairs.manoa.hawaii.edu/policies/conduct_code/proscribed_conduct.php).\n\n\n## Disability Support Service\n\nStudents requiring accommodations for disabilities should register with [the Kokua program at Student Disability Services](https://www.hawaii.edu/kokua/). It is the responsibility of the student to register for accommodations. The Kokua office will send me a notification once you are registered, however, they often do not share information regarding the specifics. If the accommodations are not sufficient to ensure your success, please contact me as soon as possible so that we may work together on providing for an effective learning environment.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThis is an applied quantitative course. I will not discuss the mathematical details of specific data analysis approaches, however some statistical background and being comfortable with quantitative thinking is useful. Previous experience with writing computer programs in general and R in particular is also helpful, but not necessary. If you have no programming experience, expect to spend extra time getting yourself familiar with R. As long as you are willing to invest the time to learn the programming and you do not mind thinking quantitatively, you should be able to take the course, independent of your background.\n\n### Getting set up\n\nYou must install [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) on your computer in order to complete this course. These are two **different** applications that must be installed separately before they can be used together:\n\n-   R is the core underlying programming language and computing engine that we will be learning in this course\n\n-   RStudio is an interface into R that makes many aspects of using and programming R simpler\n\nBoth R and RStudio are available for Windows, macOS, and most flavors of Unix and Linux. Please download the version that is suitable for your computing setup.\n\nThroughout the course, we will make use of numerous R add-on packages that must be installed over the Internet. Packages can be installed using the `install.packages()` function in R. For example, to install the `tidyverse` package, you can run\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nin the R console.\n\n#### How to Download R for Windows\n\nGo to [https://cran.r-project.org]() and\n\n1.  Click the link to \"Download R for Windows\"\n\n2.  Click on \"base\"\n\n3.  Click on \"Download R 4.2.1 for Windows\"\n\n::: callout-warning\nFor all software, please download the latest version.\n:::\n\n\n#### How to Download R for the Mac\n\nGoto [https://cran.r-project.org]() and\n\n1.  Click the link to \"Download R for (Mac) OS X\".\n\n2.  Click on \"R-4.2.1.pkg\" (or the latest version)\n\n\n#### How to Download RStudio\n\nGoto [https://rstudio.com]() and\n\n1.  Click on \"Products\" in the top menu\n\n2.  Then click on \"RStudio\" in the drop down menu\n\n3.  Click on \"RStudio Desktop\"\n\n4.  Click the button that says \"DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP\"\n\n5.  Click the button under \"RStudio Desktop\" Free\n\n6.  Under the section \"All Installers\" choose the file that is appropriate for your operating system.\n\n\n## General Disclaimers\n\n-   This syllabus is a general plan, deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.\n",

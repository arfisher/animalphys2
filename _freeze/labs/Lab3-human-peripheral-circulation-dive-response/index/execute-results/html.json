Blood is pumped from the __heart__ (the central pump) to the __vasculature__: the __arteries__, __capillary beds__ (sites of delivery to tissues), __the veins__, and back to heart.  There are several important consequences of this design: (1) blood pressure varies across species according to oxygen demand and morphology (especially animal height), (2)  __blood pressure varies along the circuit__, (3) __blood pressure can be regulated at points along the circuit__, and (4) __blood pressure can be modified situationally__ depending the state of the animal. \n\n### Blood pressure varies across species\nFor __very active__ animals (e.g., mammals and birds) or __very large animals__ (especially very tall animals that have more gravity to resist), the ability to regulate blood pressure is critical — active animals will _need more oxygen delivered at a faster rate_, especially to the most metabolically active tissues, and _larger animals will require much more pressure_ to reach all of their tissues. \n\n### Blood pressure varies during the cardiac cycle. \nThe __cardiac cycle__ is a complete cycle of the heart beat, comprised of __systole__ (@fig-systole; the phase involving contraction and ejection) and __diastole__ (@fig-diastole; relaxation and filling) of the atria and ventricles. We will learn more about the cardiac cycle in the EKG lab. In this lab we are focusing on the blood pressure changes. The largest muscles of the heart are in the __ventricles__. Blood pressure is at its highest immediately after the ventricles contract to push blood into the arterial system (@fig-wiggers; __systolic pressure__) and declines as the ventricles relax to fill with blood before pumping again. Just before the ventricles contract, blood pressure is at its lowest (__diastolic pressure__).\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noptions(tinytex.engine_args = '-shell-escape')\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../../images/Heart_systole.svg\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The human heart during the ventricular __systole__ phase of the __cardiac cycle__.](../../images/Heart_systole.svg){#fig-systole}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noptions(tinytex.engine_args = '-shell-escape')\n\nurl <- \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Heart_diasystole.svg\"\nknitr::include_graphics(url)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The heart relaxes and the ventricles fill during the __diastole__ phase of the __cardiac cycle__.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Heart_diasystole.svg){#fig-diastole}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noptions(tinytex.engine_args = '-shell-escape')\n\nurl <- \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Wiggers_Diagram_2.svg\"\nknitr::include_graphics(url)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Volume and pressure changes during the __cardiac cycle__, as shown in a Wiggers diagram.

Blood pressure drops as the blood vessels branch again and again, increasing the cross-sectional area of the circuit, until it reaches the capillaries where the tissues experience relatively constant, low pressure to facilitate __diffusion__. \n\nThe slow blood flow at the capillaries facilitates diffusion of oxygen, nutrients, and carbon dioxide and other wastes between the blood and the tissues that are bathed by the capillaries. Therefore, __pressure varies__ depending on __distance from the heart__, the __cross-sectional area of the blood vessels__, as well as __gravity__. However, at any given point along the circuit, blood pressure remains fairly constant.\n\n### Circulation can be adjusted situationally.\nAt most times, blood pressure is regulated to __maintain a relatively constant pressure__, however, there are times when __circulation needs to be adjusted__. A well-known example is the __Fight-or-Flight response__, which occurs, for example, when an animal sees a predator or anticipates a fight. The __sympathetic nervous system__ dominates and causes a ramp-up of circulation to deliver more energy to the skeletal muscles: increased __cardiac output__ (= __heart rate__ x __stroke volume__) and __blood pressure__, and increased blood flow to the lungs and skeletal muscles. In contrast, the __rest-and-digest__ response occurs after an animal has had a large meal. The __parasympathetic nervous system__ dominates, lowering heart rate, concentrates blood flow to the gut, and promotes a resting state. \n\nAdjustments to blood flow are not simply an adjustment of heart function, but also __constriction or relaxation of the vasculature__ (blood vessels: arteries, veins, capillaries). __Constricting blood vessels__ will reduce their __cross-sectional area__ and __increase blood pressure and flow__.  \n\nLocal changes in circulation are under __nervous__ and __hormonal__ control. Regulation of blood flow in the vertebrate circulatory system occurs by three primary mechanisms: 1) __local receptors__ (_nervous system_) to detect levels of metabolic activity (e.g., carbon dioxide receptors), 2) __sympathetic__ and __parasympathetic__ (_autonomic nervous system_) control of the vasculature including capillary beds at the tissues, and 3) __endocrine__ (_hormonal_) control of the vasculature. \n\nIn this lab, we will measure blood pressure of volunteers using a finger pulse transducer, a stethoscope, a blood pressure cuff (sphygnomanometer), and changes in peripheral circulation by measuring the volume of the extremities using a belt with a force transducer.  We will do a series of learning exercises and then conduct an experiment on factors affecting peripheral circulation and as well as during simulated dives (the dive response). \n\n\n## Equiptment\n\n-  PowerLab data acquisition system\n-  Finger pulse transducer\n-  Stethoscope\n-  Blood pressure cuff\n-  Blood pressure gauge (sphygnomanometer) with pod or BNC port\n-  Respiratory belt transducer\n-  LabChart software, note Blood Pressure settings\n\n# Exercise 1:  Measuring Blood Pressure\n\nTraditionally, systemic arterial blood pressure is measured using a __stethoscope__ and a __blood pressure cuff__ connected to a blood pressure gauge called a __sphygnomanometer__ (_sss-fig-no-ma-nom-eter_).  The sphygnomanometer is calibrated in pressure units of mmHg (millimeters of mercury).  Modern instruments use compressed air as a hydraulic fluid to transmit the force of your pulsing blood.\n\nRefer to \\[[Protocol 2.1 and 2.2](../Protocols/p2-measuring-blood-pressure.pdf)\\] for how to measure blood pressure.  \n\n## Setup\n1. Use “Blood Pressure” settings to start Chart software.\n2. Setup Finger Pulse transducer on Input 1.\n3. Attach sphygmomanometer transducer to Input 2 (pod input).\n\n## Data Collection\n1.  Measure blood pressure on a human volunteer using __auscultation__ (listening through a stethoscope) and a __sphygnamonometer__ . \n2.  Measure blood pressure using the PowerLab system and LabChart. Check that the __channel settings__ are correctly set for each channel.\n3.  Repeat (1) and (2) on each group member, making sure to comment your data trace. \n\n### Questions for thought... \n1.  Does the time of the first __Korotkoff sound__ (systolic pressure heard through the stethoscope), correspond with the first appearance of blood flow (as measured by the finger pulse)? Why or why not?\n2.  Would slowing the rate of pressure release from the cuff make your readings of the first appearance of blood flow more accurate? What problems might be caused by slowing pressure release?\n3.  Does the time that diastolic pressure is heard through the stethoscope correspond with anything particular in the blood flow signal? Can you, therefore, use pulse measurement to replace the stethoscope?\n4.  How much variation in measurement of diastolic and systolic pressures was observed within and between individuals?  What are potential sources of variation in these estimates?\n\n\n# Exercise 2: Exploring Peripheral Circulation\n\n## Objectives\nTo demonstrate basic principles of peripheral circulation using blood pressure data from the extremities. What you would expect based on relative distance from the heart and gravity (and whether the location is above or below the heart)?\n\n## Procedure\n1.  _Brainstorm with your lab group to develop some simple experiments to demonstrate principles of peripheral circulation._ What are some good hypotheses for peripheral blood pressure?\n2.  What are some good locations to measure (or other simple manipulations) for comparison? Make sure you place the stethoscope on a major artery or vein such as the radial artery on the forearm, or the small saphenous vein on the calf. Ask for help if you don’t know where they are. Be specific when you write up your methods or we will not understand what you did.\n3.  For each experiment, __determine both systolic and diastolic blood pressure__.\n\n### Notes\n1.  You may need to recalibrate the blood pressure force transducer after each time you move the cuff.\n2.  Place the instruments directly on the skin (not through clothes).  \n3.  When measuring from foot, please wash toe before attaching pulse transducer to prevent any fungal contamination.\n4.  **Always Release the cuff pressure _completely_ as soon as you are done taking data** \n\n### Analysis\nCompare systolic and diastolic pressure for each of your treatments versus an appropriate control. Think carefully about appropriate controls for your ideas to achieve the best test of your hypotheses. \n\n### Questions for thought...\n1.  How much does blood pressure change for each treatment? What could explain it? Does it seam reasonable?\n2.  How much variation is there among members of your group?  What are sources of variation in these estimates?\n\n# Exercise 3: The Dive Response\nWhen an air-breathing animal dives, it voluntarily holds its breath while the tissues continue to use oxygen. The __dive response__ is a reflexive response that reorganizes circulation to maintain blood flow to the most essential organs -- the brain, eyes, and myocardium (heart muscle), while reducing blood flow to the peripheral tissues including musculature of the limbs and thorax, lungs, and renal system. Remarkably, all vertebrates have a dive response. The responses vary greatly between taxa, with some of the most pronounced being in whales and diving seals.\n\nA primary feature of the dive response is a __diving bradycardia__ (slowing of the heart rate), which results in a dramatic drop in __cardiac output__ (__cardiac output__ = __heart rate x stroke volume__). You might think that this would result in a dramatic drop in blood pressure as well, but in addition to reduced cardiac output, another component of the dive response is __peripheral vasoconstriction__, where the blood vessels of the peripheral tissues are constricted or even closed. As a whole, the dive response preserves circulation around the vital organs while reducing circulation to the peripheral tissues. Oxygen becomes depleted and carbon dioxide and lactate build up in the tissues during a dive. When the animal resurfaces, there is a recovery period characterized by more rapid heart rate and ventilation to absorb more oxygen and flush out lactate and carbon dioxide.\n\n## Objectives \nYou will investigate the effects of the diving response on heart rate and peripheral circulation in humans during simulated dives.  First, you will examine the effect of holding your breath, then you will examine the effects of simulated dives.  Finally, you will do a series of experiments to determine which stimuli contribute to triggering the dive response. One person will serve as the experimental subject.  If time permits, each person in the group should take turns being the experimental subject to have more replication.\n\n\n## Additional Required Equipment \n-  Respiratory Belt Transducer\n-  Wash basin, Ice, Thermometer\n-  Duct tape\n-  Use the Dive settings file\n\n\n## A.  Set up {#sec-divesetup}\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![Attachment of the respiratory belt transducer to the calf for leg volume measurement.](../../images/calf_belt.jpg){#fig-calf}\n:::\n\n1.  Use the Exercise 1 setup with the addition of the Respiratory Belt Transducer to input 3 (or 2) to measure leg volume. Check the channel settings to make sure they match the inputs. Ask your TA for the proper settings.\n2.  Attach the respiratory belt snugly to the calf (@fig-calf). _It should feel tight and the sensor fabric should be slightly stretched._ \n3.  Place the sphygnomanometer cuff around the subject’s thigh, and _duct tape it securely so that it can be pressurized to restrict blood flow_. Be sure to apply tape to _secure both the top and the bottom_ of the cuff. \n3.  Record for 10 seconds and stop. Scale the Pulse channel and the Leg Volume channel  to fully display the data. \n4.  Record again and test by flexing and relaxing your calf. _You should be able to see a clear deflection on the leg volume channel._ If it is very small, try tightening the respiratory belt a little. Check with your TA before moving on.\n4.  Use a timer to time the treatments (a cell phone or a web browser will do).  \n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## The idea behind measuring peripheral circulation using leg volume changes\nWe can quantify the volume in your peripheral circulation (specifically your lower leg) by assessing __venous pooling__ for a standard time interval. By constricting blood flow to the lower limb, we will prevent venous return of the blood. Because the veins do not have much smooth muscle, it is relatively easy to stop venous return. \n\nYou will use the sphygnomanometer cuff to cut off circulation in the leg for 30 sec. at the upper thigh. The respiratory belt transducer senses stretch and can be used to measure __calf volume__ (@fig-calf) __before__ inflating the cuff, __after 30 sec of inflation__, and __after deflating__ the cuff.  \n\n__The resulting _leg volume_ difference__ (maximum-minimum volume at T1 vs. T2; @fig-legvol) is a measure of pooling and therefore peripheral circulation. For each experiment, we will compare the __degree of pooling__ at __rest__, during the __experimental treatment__, and during the __recovery__ periods.\n::: \n\n::: {.column-margin}\n\n![Zoom window view of measuring the leg volume change resulting from a simulated dive using a marker at T1 (30sec of cuff inflation) and the waveform cursor at T2 (maximum leg volume drop after releasing the pressure).](../../images/legvol.jpg){#fig-legvol}\n\n:::\n\n::: {#prot-legvol .callout-tip}\n# Protocol: Leg volume measurement  {#prot-legvol}\n-  Record the subject’s resting pulse for 15 seconds.\n-  __Inflate__ the cuff to __80 mmHg__ (or whatever pressure feels tight enough to restrict blood flow for the subject), \n-  __Hold pressure__ for __exactly 30 seconds__   (_NOTE: You may have to gently squeeze the bulb to keep pressure at 80 mmHg._) \n-  __Quickly and COMPLETELY release__ the pressure (@fig-legvol). \n-  Record until the volume returns to baseline.  \n\n[NOTES: Comment at __start__, at __start to inflate__, at __pressure__, and at __deflate__.]{style=\"color: blue\"}   \nWhen doing repeated measurements, ensure you have __baseline data__ for _at least 15 sec_ before inflating the cuff again. The leg volume measurement will take a little over a minute total.  \n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n# Collecting leg volume data from the volume trace: \n-  Set the Marker to a region just prior to cuff deflation in the leg volume channel (@fig-legvol).\n-  Use the Waveform Cursor to determine the relative change in leg volume for the data trace when the cuff was deflated.\n:::\n\n\n\n## B.  Breath holding experiment\n\n1.  Use the [Section A setup](@sec-divesetup) with the respiratory belt on the calf (@fig-calf) and the sphygnomanometer cuff on the upper thigh. \n2.  Measure __leg volume at rest__ \\[[Protocol: Leg volume measurement](@prot-legvol)\\].  \n3.  __Breath hold treatment__ (will require breath hold of ~1min): \n    a.  Have the subject take one or two deep breaths, exhale partially, and then hold their breath while they place their head down on the lab bench.  \n    b.  Start a timer with the start of breath hold (cell phone or find a timer online). _The experimenter should tap on the subjectʻs shoulder every 10 sec to help them track time._ \n    c.  Measure __leg volume 30 seconds into the breath-hold__.  \n5.  Measure __leg volume during recovery__: at 30 sec into the recovery.  \n\n[Make sure to __comment at each step__ and __DEFLATE CUFF COMPLETELY__ each time.]{style=\"color: blue\"} \n\n\n## C. Dive response experiment\n\nFill your bucket with icewater deep enough to submerge your face up to your temples.  Use a thermometer to monitor temperature. _Note: The receptors that trigger the dive response are in the temples, so it is critical that the temples be submerged in order to see the dive response._\n\n1. [Section A setup](@sec-divesetup).\n2. Before beginning, allow the subject to find a comforable chair height and leg posture to allow them to remain as motionless as possible throughout the experiment. Most people sit, but standing is OK if preferred.\n3. __Resting:__ \n    a. Have the subject position their face just above the water’s surface, and remain motionless. \n    b. Perform a __leg volume measurement__. (reminder: record the baseline, while restricting blood flow, and recovery.)\n3.  __Simulated Dive:__ \n    a. If you feel the need to, practice a simulated dive and recovery with a dry run (without submerging face) before conducting the experiment.) \n    b.  While recording, have the subject take a deep breath, exhale partially, and then hold their breath while immersing their face up to their temples in the pan of water for 30 sec. \n    c. Perform a __leg volume measurement__ 30 sec into the simulated dive. \n    d. At the end of the simulated dive, signal to the subject to resurface. \n4.  __Recovery:__ Perform a __leg volume measurement__ 30 sec into recovery.  \n5.  Continue to record for another 15 seconds. \n\n:::{.callout-note}\n# NOTES: \n-  __Make sure everything is very clear before beginning__ to avoid repeating this experiment.\n-  One member of the group should tap the subject on the back at 10-second intervals while immersed to help them keep track of the time and prevent anxiety. \n-  Work out in advance what your signals will be for timing vs. resurfacing.\n-  Make __good comments__ and __minimize movement__ in the Finger Pulse Transducer. \n-  _Do not force the subject to remain submerged_.  \n:::\n\n## D. Additional Experiment\nThe experiments above provide a basic demonstration of the dive response.  However, the experiment involved multiple stimuli simultaneously. __Brainstorm__ how you might _identify the components which are actually “triggering” the dive response by isolating stimuli._ Are these components all necessary? Are they additive?\n\nEach group should __design an experiment to isolate one potential stimulus__ responsible for triggering the dive response and perform it.  Get your idea approved by your TA. Share your results with the other groups.  _Make sure you explain your methods carefully (including your logic) in your lab report._\n\n## Analysis\n1.  Compare the heart rate, pulse volume, and leg volumes before, during and after a breath-hold. \n2.  Do the same for your simulated dive as well as for your additional experiment.\n\n## Questions for thought . . . \n1.  Compare your results of heart rate during breath holding with those from simulated dives.  Are they the same?\n2.  What factors could explain differences between breath holding and a “dive”? Have you eliminated any hypotheses with your experiments?\n3.  Compare the percent change in heart rate during dives among the members of your group.  Is the relative bradycardia similar?  Or is the absolute difference similar?  What comparisons can you make between different treatments to dig deeper into your numbers?\n4.  Do your results for leg volume suggest that peripheral circulation changes during a breath-hold? What specific result points to this?\n5.  Did your peripheral circulation increase or decrease during a “dive”?\n6.  Why do you think the diving response is considered advantageous?\n\n\n# After Lab: Assignment Week 3:\n\n- You will work with your lab group to analyze data, and you may share figures if you wish. However, each person will submit an __Individual WorkSheet__ \\[[html](Lab3ws.qmd)\\]\n- Reminder: _Practical has been moved to next week (week 4) on Lab 1 material_.

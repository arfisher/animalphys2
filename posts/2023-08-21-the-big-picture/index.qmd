## Animal Physiology is the science of life and how it works {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
- [_Mechanistic_]{style="color: blue"} as well as [_evolutionary_]{style="color: blue"} explanations
- [_Internal_]{style="color: blue"} to the organism as well as [_environmental_]{style="color: blue"} context

## Learning by doing —- Project Based {.scrollable}

::: {.incremental}
- __Readings__ at home
- In-Class __Discussion__ to flesh out ideas and push
- __Homeworks__ challenge us to use the information
  + _Calculations prepare us for the Design Projects_
- Building on the shoulders of giants 
  + _Gathering background for best assumptions_
- __Short reports__ allow us to create new knowledge
  + _Oral Presentations test “work in progress”_
- Peer and Instructor __Reviews__ to hone work
- __Final Draft__ - Voila!

[Not Busywork!!]{style="color: blue"}

## Design Project {.scrollable  .smaller}
Together with your partner, you will choose an [extinct vertebrate]{style="color: blue"} to study.  
::: {.incremental}
- Background Research: 
  + Create a strong foundation for modeling your animalʻs biology and physiology
- Model (short reports):  
  + Activity budget, metabolism and heat balance. 
  + Diet and digestion
  + Respiration
  + Osmoregulation and excretion
- Term paper on your most interesting design project
:::


## Goals

- Creativity
- Accuracy
- Authority
- Repeatability
- Communication
  + Ease of dissemination to other researchers
  + [_Show me, don't tell me_]{style="color: blue"}

## Useful Mindsets {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
- Demand Excellence
- Criticism helps us to improve
- Developing a thick skin makes it easier!
- Learning is a developmental process - [_UNCOMFORTABLE_]{style="color: red"}
- Science is collaborative - [Respect]{style="color: red"}
- Thinking is improved through _reflection and revision_
- __Effort and Attitude Counts — a LOT !!!__
- Science is creative
- Mastery will prepare you for life  
:::  

#### _Learning is a Process_

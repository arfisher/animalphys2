This week will be a little odd. Monday we will do the Sustained metabolic scope discussion originally scheduled for last Friday. Wednesday we will start talking about feeding (our favorite topic!) and digestion. Friday we will have a special treat - Allison will lead a workshop to help you improve your design 1 drafts.  Bring your drafts!

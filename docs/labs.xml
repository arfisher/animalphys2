<h1>Background: Blood pressure and peripheral circulation</h1>
<p>Vertebrates have a <strong>closed circulatory system</strong> where the blood is always enclosed within blood vessels or the heart. Blood is pumped from the <strong>heart</strong> (the central pump) to the <strong>vasculature</strong>: the <strong>arteries</strong>, <strong>capillary beds</strong> (sites of delivery to tissues), <strong>the veins</strong>, and back to heart. There are several important consequences of this design: (1) blood pressure varies across species according to oxygen demand and morphology (especially animal height), (2) <strong>blood pressure varies along the circuit</strong>, (3) <strong>blood pressure can be regulated at points along the circuit</strong>, and (4) <strong>blood pressure can be modified situationally</strong> depending the state of the animal.</p>
<section id="blood-pressure-varies-across-species" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="blood-pressure-varies-across-species">Blood pressure varies across species</h3>
<p>For <strong>very active</strong> animals (e.g., mammals and birds) or <strong>very large animals</strong> (especially very tall animals that have more gravity to resist), the ability to regulate blood pressure is critical — active animals will <em>need more oxygen delivered at a faster rate</em>, especially to the most metabolically active tissues, and <em>larger animals will require much more pressure</em> to reach all of their tissues.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="blood-pressure-varies-during-the-cardiac-cycle.">Blood pressure varies during the cardiac cycle.</h3>
<p>The <strong>cardiac cycle</strong> is a complete cycle of the heart beat, comprised of <strong>systole</strong> (Figure&nbsp;1; the phase involving contraction and ejection) and <strong>diastole</strong> (Figure&nbsp;2; relaxation and filling) of the atria and ventricles. We will learn more about the cardiac cycle in the EKG lab. In this lab we are focusing on the blood pressure changes. The largest muscles of the heart are in the <strong>ventricles</strong>. Blood pressure is at its highest immediately after the ventricles contract to push blood into the arterial system (Figure&nbsp;3; <strong>systolic pressure</strong>) and declines as the ventricles relax to fill with blood before pumping again. Just before the ventricles contract, blood pressure is at its lowest (<strong>diastolic pressure</strong>).</p>

<section id="blood-pressure-varies-along-the-vascular-circuit." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="blood-pressure-varies-along-the-vascular-circuit.">Blood pressure varies along the vascular circuit.</h3>
<p>Blood in the arteries leaving the heart is always at very high pressure as compared to the low pressure in the veins in the legs or the even lower pressure in capillary beds at the tissues. Blood pressure drops as the blood vessels branch again and again, increasing the cross-sectional area of the circuit, until it reaches the capillaries where the tissues experience relatively constant, low pressure to facilitate <strong>diffusion</strong>.</p>
<p>The slow blood flow at the capillaries facilitates diffusion of oxygen, nutrients, and carbon dioxide and other wastes between the blood and the tissues that are bathed by the capillaries. Therefore, <strong>pressure varies</strong> depending on <strong>distance from the heart</strong>, the <strong>cross-sectional area of the blood vessels</strong>, as well as <strong>gravity</strong>. However, at any given point along the circuit, blood pressure remains fairly constant.</p>
</section>
<section id="circulation-can-be-adjusted-situationally." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="circulation-can-be-adjusted-situationally.">Circulation can be adjusted situationally.</h3>
<p>At most times, blood pressure is regulated to <strong>maintain a relatively constant pressure</strong>, however, there are times when <strong>circulation needs to be adjusted</strong>. A well-known example is the <strong>Fight-or-Flight response</strong>, which occurs, for example, when an animal sees a predator or anticipates a fight. The <strong>sympathetic nervous system</strong> dominates and causes a ramp-up of circulation to deliver more energy to the skeletal muscles: increased <strong>cardiac output</strong> (= <strong>heart rate</strong> x <strong>stroke volume</strong>) and <strong>blood pressure</strong>, and increased blood flow to the lungs and skeletal muscles. In contrast, the <strong>rest-and-digest</strong> response occurs after an animal has had a large meal. The <strong>parasympathetic nervous system</strong> dominates, lowering heart rate, concentrates blood flow to the gut, and promotes a resting state.</p>
<p>Adjustments to blood flow are not simply an adjustment of heart function, but also <strong>constriction or relaxation of the vasculature</strong> (blood vessels: arteries, veins, capillaries). <strong>Constricting blood vessels</strong> will reduce their <strong>cross-sectional area</strong> and <strong>increase blood pressure and flow</strong>.</p>
<p>Local changes in circulation are under <strong>nervous</strong> and <strong>hormonal</strong> control. Regulation of blood flow in the vertebrate circulatory system occurs by three primary mechanisms: 1) <strong>local receptors</strong> (<em>nervous system</em>) to detect levels of metabolic activity (e.g., carbon dioxide receptors), 2) <strong>sympathetic</strong> and <strong>parasympathetic</strong> (<em>autonomic nervous system</em>) control of the vasculature including capillary beds at the tissues, and 3) <strong>endocrine</strong> (<em>hormonal</em>) control of the vasculature.</p>
<p>In this lab, we will measure blood pressure of volunteers using a finger pulse transducer, a stethoscope, a blood pressure cuff (sphygnomanometer), and changes in peripheral circulation by measuring the volume of the extremities using a belt with a force transducer. We will do a series of learning exercises and then conduct an experiment on factors affecting peripheral circulation and as well as during simulated dives (the dive response).</p>

<h1>Exercise 1: Measuring Blood Pressure</h1>
<p>Traditionally, systemic arterial blood pressure is measured using a <strong>stethoscope</strong> and a <strong>blood pressure cuff</strong> connected to a blood pressure gauge called a <strong>sphygnomanometer</strong> (<em>sss-fig-no-ma-nom-eter</em>). The sphygnomanometer is calibrated in pressure units of mmHg (millimeters of mercury). Modern instruments use compressed air as a hydraulic fluid to transmit the force of your pulsing blood.</p>

<section id="exercise-3-the-dive-response" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Exercise 3: The Dive Response</h1>
<p>When an air-breathing animal dives, it voluntarily holds its breath while the tissues continue to use oxygen. The <strong>dive response</strong> is a reflexive response that reorganizes circulation to maintain blood flow to the most essential organs – the brain, eyes, and myocardium (heart muscle), while reducing blood flow to the peripheral tissues including musculature of the limbs and thorax, lungs, and renal system. Remarkably, all vertebrates have a dive response. The responses vary greatly between taxa, with some of the most pronounced being in whales and diving seals.</p>
<p>A primary feature of the dive response is a <strong>diving bradycardia</strong> (slowing of the heart rate), which results in a dramatic drop in <strong>cardiac output</strong> (<strong>cardiac output</strong> = <strong>heart rate x stroke volume</strong>). You might think that this would result in a dramatic drop in blood pressure as well, but in addition to reduced cardiac output, another component of the dive response is <strong>peripheral vasoconstriction</strong>, where the blood vessels of the peripheral tissues are constricted or even closed. As a whole, the dive response preserves circulation around the vital organs while reducing circulation to the peripheral tissues. Oxygen becomes depleted and carbon dioxide and lactate build up in the tissues during a dive. When the animal resurfaces, there is a recovery period characterized by more rapid heart rate and ventilation to absorb more oxygen and flush out lactate and carbon dioxide.</p>
<section id="objectives-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="objectives-1">Objectives</h2>
<p>You will investigate the effects of the diving response on heart rate and peripheral circulation in humans during simulated dives. First, you will examine the effect of holding your breath, then you will examine the effects of simulated dives. Finally, you will do a series of experiments to determine which stimuli contribute to triggering the dive response. One person will serve as the experimental subject. If time permits, each person in the group should take turns being the experimental subject to have more replication.</p>

The idea behind measuring peripheral circulation using leg volume changes
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>We can quantify the volume in your peripheral circulation (specifically your lower leg) by assessing <strong>venous pooling</strong> for a standard time interval. By constricting blood flow to the lower limb, we will prevent venous return of the blood. Because the veins do not have much smooth muscle, it is relatively easy to stop venous return.</p>
<p>You will use the sphygnomanometer cuff to cut off circulation in the leg for 30 sec.&nbsp;at the upper thigh. The respiratory belt transducer senses stretch and can be used to measure <strong>calf volume</strong> (Figure&nbsp;4) <strong>before</strong> inflating the cuff, <strong>after 30 sec of inflation</strong>, and <strong>after deflating</strong> the cuff.</p>
<p><strong>The resulting <em>leg volume</em> difference</strong> (maximum-minimum volume at T1 vs.&nbsp;T2; Figure&nbsp;5) is a measure of pooling and therefore peripheral circulation. For each experiment, we will compare the <strong>degree of pooling</strong> at <strong>rest</strong>, during the <strong>experimental treatment</strong>, and during the <strong>recovery</strong> periods.</p>

<p>The experiments above provide a basic demonstration of the dive response. However, the experiment involved multiple stimuli simultaneously. <strong>Brainstorm</strong> how you might <em>identify the components which are actually “triggering” the dive response by isolating stimuli.</em> Are these components all necessary? Are they additive?</p>
<p>Each group should <strong>design an experiment to isolate one potential stimulus</strong> responsible for triggering the dive response and perform it. Get your idea approved by your TA. Share your results with the other groups. <em>Make sure you explain your methods carefully (including your logic) in your lab report.</em></p>

<li>What factors could explain differences between breath holding and a “dive”? Have you eliminated any hypotheses with your experiments?</li>
<li>Compare the percent change in heart rate during dives among the members of your group. Is the relative bradycardia similar? Or is the absolute difference similar? What comparisons can you make between different treatments to dig deeper into your numbers?</li>
<li>Do your results for leg volume suggest that peripheral circulation changes during a breath-hold? What specific result points to this?</li>
<li>Did your peripheral circulation increase or decrease during a “dive”?</li>
<li>Why do you think the diving response is considered advantageous?</li>

<p><strong>Use these statements of purpose to frame your thinking about this lab, complete them as needed:</strong></p>
<p><em>Distance from heart</em> – “We demonstrate the predicted drop in blood pressure with distance from the central pump. We explore whether there is a greater drop in systolic or diastolic pressure with distance” (in a full lab report you would set up your ideas for why it might go either way).</p>
<p><em>Effect of gravity</em> – “We demonstrate the action of gravity on blood pressure. As vertebrates possess a closed circulatory system, vertical height should contribute to blood pressure in predictable ways.”</p>
<p><em>Dive response</em> – “When diving, peripheral circulation should be reorganized to reduce cardiac output and increase peripheral vasoconstriction, called the dive response. We aim to observe the dive response by measuring ________________________.”</p>
<p><em>Stimulus for dive response</em> – “We will test potential triggers for the dive response including ____________________________.””</p>

<h1>Focal Observation</h1>
<p>As a group choose an animal to observe.</p>
<section id="collect-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="collect-data">Collect Data:</h2>
<p><strong>Mass:</strong> Approximate the dimensions of your animal. Approximate the volume of your animal, by whatever geometric approximation seems reasonable to you. Animals are ~70% water. Estimate mass from the density of water (1g/cm^3).</p>
<p>FYI: Volume of a cylinder: V = π<em>r2</em>length (use metric units!!)</p>
<p><strong>Behavior:</strong> (focus on intensity of effort and time budget)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>15 min observation focal observation</li>
</ol>
<p>Each group member will collect a 15 min focal observation. Record in your notebook everything your animal does during the 15 min observation period, recording activity and duration.</p>
<p>For example: + Lying on ground 10 min (can add comments or social context, etc.) + Walking slowly 1 min + Etc.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Also record general info: species, male/female/adult/juvenile etc., time of day, habitat and surroundings, any conspecifics nearby?</li>
<li>After your focal observation, write some general impressions. How would you characterize your animalʻs behavior? What seems to be motivating your animal? (note anything relevant, like keeps looking toward a male, trying to reach food, etc.).<br>
</li>
<li>Note any behaviors related to temperature exchange: Basking? Seeking shade? Pressing their body against a cool surface (conduction)? Enjoying strong wind (convection)? Wet? Etc.</li>
<li>Take photos and videos that capture the essence of your animal or show something interesting.</li>
<li>Optional: Your animal may or may not do very much during your observation period. You can also take “scan samples” periodically. Say every hour or half hour, what is your animal doing? Who is nearby?</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis"><strong>Analysis:</strong></h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Construct a mass model for your animal.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>BMR</strong> or <strong>SMR</strong>. Choose an appropriate scaling equation for BMR or SMR from Withers 1991 Table 4-5 and calculate the lowest metabolic rate for your animal. If an ectotherm, guestimate what the animal’s Tb is.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Time Budget:</strong> Analyze your focal observation and use it to estimate a time budget. With your team members, decide on the intensity levels of each type of behavior. Based on your own experience, assign effort levels to each type of behavior. (divide activities into say, 3 categories of effort). Estimate the percent of time spent in each category based on your observation and other information you may know.</li>
<li>Use Table 4-10 to select appropriate activity multipliers for each category. For example, RMR might be 1.2x BMR based on … in Table 4-10. In general, very inactive animals will have a lower RMR (say 1.1. Or 1.2x BMR) than very active animals (say 1.5 x BMR).<br>
</li>
<li><strong>DMR:</strong> Take an educated guess about how many hours your animal spends sleeping or resting, and in each of your active categories. Construct a model for the cost of 1 day. We call this DMR or daily metabolic rate. For example, your animalʻs DMR might be = 16 hrs x RMR + 1 hr x AMR(activity 1) + 7hr x AMR(activity 2). Etc.</li>

<section id="report" class="level1">
<h1><strong>Report:</strong></h1>
<p>Your assignment is to write a group short lab report with the following sections:</p>
<p><em>Intro:</em></p>
<p>Write a short paragraph describing your animal. What do you think the relevant background should include? End with a statement of purpose.</p>
<p><em>Methods (~2-3 concise paragraphs):</em></p>
<ul>
<li>State how you collected your data. “Focal observations were conducted… “<br>
</li>
<li>State what you modeled. For each model, explain how you calculated it. Remember, you are making it up so you have to explain your logic so that someone outside the class could understand. Include your equations and all the assumptions or estimations you used to model mass, BMR/SMR, one or more AMRs, and DMR.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Results (probably ~1-2 paragraphs, grouped by topic):</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What did your animal do? What was itʻs primary activity? Look at your results and think about how best to convey the main findings. A table of activities and time? Or perhaps grouped into resting, low intensity, high intensity activities? You decide.<br>
</li>
<li>Report your mass, and all MRʻs. Also report mass-specific BMR and DMR.<br>
</li>
<li>Notes on the observed behavior of the animal.<br>
</li>
<li>Include photos or video clips to help tell the story of your animal.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Discussion (1 or more paragraphs, depending on how much you have to say - no fluff!):</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A small discussion that sheds light on your findings. All in all, how would you characterize your animal? Is it an active animal or a sedentary animal?<br>
</li>
<li>Any insight into what guides its energy consumption? Based on your observations, what did itʻs main concern seem to be? Here is a good place to add in some of your observations to back up your characterization. The discussion is where you can speculate a little about what your data might mean.<br>
</li>
<li>Comment on any temperature-regulation behaviors.<br>
</li>
<li>Conclusion: What do your findings imply? Do you understand more about your animal? Does it make sense, given that itʻs a large/small predator/herbivore, etc. What could be some fruitful next steps if you were to continue the research? (do you think the behavior of your animal would be different in the wild?, etc. )</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Respective Contributions:</em> Each lab group member is expected to participate meaningfully in data collection, data analysis, lab report writing, and lab report editing. Please identify a project coordinator for this lab.</p>
<section id="submit" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="submit">Submit:</h2>
<p>Write up your short group lab report and include photos and links to videos that you took. If you provide a link to a video on your google drive, be sure to make it public so we can see it. Include your group member names in the report.</p>
<p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Clarity of ideas is highly prized in science, which is more obvious when you are concise. Do include any relevant scientific terms (BMR, DMR, etc.), but other than that, use plain, direct language that gets straight to the point and your writing will be stronger.</p>

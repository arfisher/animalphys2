<h1>Background: Blood pressure and peripheral circulation</h1>
<p>Vertebrates have a <strong>closed circulatory system</strong> where the blood is always enclosed within blood vessels or the heart. Blood is pumped from the <strong>heart</strong> (the central pump) to the <strong>vasculature</strong>: the <strong>arteries</strong>, <strong>capillary beds</strong> (sites of delivery to tissues), <strong>the veins</strong>, and back to heart. There are several important consequences of this design: (1) blood pressure varies across species according to oxygen demand and morphology (especially animal height), (2) <strong>blood pressure varies along the circuit</strong>, (3) <strong>blood pressure can be regulated at points along the circuit</strong>, and (4) <strong>blood pressure can be modified situationally</strong> depending the state of the animal.</p>
<section id="blood-pressure-varies-across-species" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="blood-pressure-varies-across-species">Blood pressure varies across species</h3>
<p>For <strong>very active</strong> animals (e.g., mammals and birds) or <strong>very large animals</strong> (especially very tall animals that have more gravity to resist), the ability to regulate blood pressure is critical — active animals will <em>need more oxygen delivered at a faster rate</em>, especially to the most metabolically active tissues, and <em>larger animals will require much more pressure</em> to reach all of their tissues.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="blood-pressure-varies-during-the-cardiac-cycle.">Blood pressure varies during the cardiac cycle.</h3>
<p>The <strong>cardiac cycle</strong> is a complete cycle of the heart beat, comprised of <strong>systole</strong> (Figure&nbsp;1; the phase involving contraction and ejection) and <strong>diastole</strong> (Figure&nbsp;2; relaxation and filling) of the atria and ventricles. We will learn more about the cardiac cycle in the EKG lab. In this lab we are focusing on the blood pressure changes. The largest muscles of the heart are in the <strong>ventricles</strong>. Blood pressure is at its highest immediately after the ventricles contract to push blood into the arterial system (Figure&nbsp;3; <strong>systolic pressure</strong>) and declines as the ventricles relax to fill with blood before pumping again. Just before the ventricles contract, blood pressure is at its lowest (<strong>diastolic pressure</strong>).</p>

<section id="blood-pressure-varies-along-the-vascular-circuit." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="blood-pressure-varies-along-the-vascular-circuit.">Blood pressure varies along the vascular circuit.</h3>
<p>Blood in the arteries leaving the heart is always at very high pressure as compared to the low pressure in the veins in the legs or the even lower pressure in capillary beds at the tissues. Blood pressure drops as the blood vessels branch again and again, increasing the cross-sectional area of the circuit, until it reaches the capillaries where the tissues experience relatively constant, low pressure to facilitate <strong>diffusion</strong>.</p>
<p>The slow blood flow at the capillaries facilitates diffusion of oxygen, nutrients, and carbon dioxide and other wastes between the blood and the tissues that are bathed by the capillaries. Therefore, <strong>pressure varies</strong> depending on <strong>distance from the heart</strong>, the <strong>cross-sectional area of the blood vessels</strong>, as well as <strong>gravity</strong>. However, at any given point along the circuit, blood pressure remains fairly constant.</p>
</section>
<section id="circulation-can-be-adjusted-situationally." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="circulation-can-be-adjusted-situationally.">Circulation can be adjusted situationally.</h3>
<p>At most times, blood pressure is regulated to <strong>maintain a relatively constant pressure</strong>, however, there are times when <strong>circulation needs to be adjusted</strong>. A well-known example is the <strong>Fight-or-Flight response</strong>, which occurs, for example, when an animal sees a predator or anticipates a fight. The <strong>sympathetic nervous system</strong> dominates and causes a ramp-up of circulation to deliver more energy to the skeletal muscles: increased <strong>cardiac output</strong> (= <strong>heart rate</strong> x <strong>stroke volume</strong>) and <strong>blood pressure</strong>, and increased blood flow to the lungs and skeletal muscles. In contrast, the <strong>rest-and-digest</strong> response occurs after an animal has had a large meal. The <strong>parasympathetic nervous system</strong> dominates, lowering heart rate, concentrates blood flow to the gut, and promotes a resting state.</p>
<p>Adjustments to blood flow are not simply an adjustment of heart function, but also <strong>constriction or relaxation of the vasculature</strong> (blood vessels: arteries, veins, capillaries). <strong>Constricting blood vessels</strong> will reduce their <strong>cross-sectional area</strong> and <strong>increase blood pressure and flow</strong>.</p>
<p>Local changes in circulation are under <strong>nervous</strong> and <strong>hormonal</strong> control. Regulation of blood flow in the vertebrate circulatory system occurs by three primary mechanisms: 1) <strong>local receptors</strong> (<em>nervous system</em>) to detect levels of metabolic activity (e.g., carbon dioxide receptors), 2) <strong>sympathetic</strong> and <strong>parasympathetic</strong> (<em>autonomic nervous system</em>) control of the vasculature including capillary beds at the tissues, and 3) <strong>endocrine</strong> (<em>hormonal</em>) control of the vasculature.</p>
<p>In this lab, we will measure blood pressure of volunteers using a finger pulse transducer, a stethoscope, a blood pressure cuff (sphygnomanometer), and changes in peripheral circulation by measuring the volume of the extremities using a belt with a force transducer. We will do a series of learning exercises and then conduct an experiment on factors affecting peripheral circulation and as well as during simulated dives (the dive response).</p>

<section id="exercise-3-the-dive-response" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Exercise 3: The Dive Response</h1>
<p>When an air-breathing animal dives, it voluntarily holds its breath while the tissues continue to use oxygen. The <strong>dive response</strong> is a reflexive response that reorganizes circulation to maintain blood flow to the most essential organs – the brain, eyes, and myocardium (heart muscle), while reducing blood flow to the peripheral tissues including musculature of the limbs and thorax, lungs, and renal system. Remarkably, all vertebrates have a dive response. The responses vary greatly between taxa, with some of the most pronounced being in whales and diving seals.</p>
<p>Primary features of the human <strong>dive response</strong> are the rapid onset of <strong>bradycardia</strong> (slowing of the <em>heart rate</em>), which works together with <strong>peripheral vasoconstriction</strong> to shunt blood toward the bodyʻs core. This causes an increase in the volume of blood returning to the <strong>heart</strong> and an increase in <strong>stroke volume</strong>. These in turn cause an increase in <strong>arterial blood pressure</strong>. To counteract this increase in blood pressure and reduce overall blood flow, there is a <em>drop in heart rate</em>.</p>
<p>As a whole, the dive response preserves circulation around the vital organs while reducing circulation to the peripheral tissues. Oxygen becomes depleted and carbon dioxide and lactate build up in the tissues during a dive. When the animal resurfaces, there is a recovery period characterized by more rapid heart rate and ventilation to absorb more oxygen and flush out lactate and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>The dive response is triggered by sudden submergence of the face in cold water, which stimulates the <em>trigeminal nerve receptors</em> around the nose. Stimulation is enhanced with colder temperature, which inhibits the cardiovascular center, as well as increasing parasympathetic output and reducing sympathetic output, both of which reduce heart rate.</p>
<section id="objectives-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="objectives-1">Objectives</h2>
<p>You will investigate the effects of the diving response on heart rate and peripheral circulation in humans during simulated dives. First, you will examine the effect of holding your breath, then you will examine the effects of simulated dives, and an experiment to determine which stimuli contribute to triggering the dive response. One person will serve as the experimental subject.</p>

<li>Switch the PowerLab to the Dive Response settings. You should have the Finger Pulse transducer in channel 1 and the Respiratory Belt Transducer to input 2 to measure leg volume. Check the channel settings to make sure they match the inputs. Ask your TA for the proper settings. In this experiment, the sphygnamanometer is used to pressurize the thigh and not plugged in to PowerLab.</li>
<li>Set up and maintain a wash basin with icewater deep enough to submerge your face up to your temples. Use a thermometer to monitor temperature at 10-15C (50-60F), replenish with ice as needed.</li>
<li>Attach the respiratory belt snugly to the calf (Figure&nbsp;4). <em>It should feel tight and the sensor fabric should be slightly stretched.</em></li>
<li>Place the sphygnomanometer cuff around the subject’s thigh, and <em>duct tape it securely so that it can be pressurized to restrict blood flow</em>. Be sure to apply tape to <em>secure both the top and the bottom</em> of the cuff.</li>
<li>Record for 10 seconds and stop. Scale the Pulse channel and the Leg Volume channel to fully display the data.</li>
<li>Record again and test by flexing and relaxing your calf. <em>You should be able to see a clear deflection on the leg volume channel.</em> If it is very small, try tightening the respiratory belt a little. Check with your TA before moving on.</li>
<li>For all experiments, <em>resting position for the subject is leaning over the basin with the face just aboe water.</em></li>
<li>Use a timer to time the treatments (a cell phone or a web browser will do).</li>

The idea behind measuring peripheral circulation using leg volume changes
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>We can quantify the volume in your peripheral circulation (specifically your lower leg) by assessing <strong>venous pooling</strong> for a standard time interval. By constricting blood flow to the lower limb, we will prevent venous return of the blood. Because the veins have little smooth muscle, it is relatively easy to stop venous return.</p>

Protocol: Basic Leg volume measurement
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>You will use the sphygnomanometer cuff to cut off circulation in the leg for 20 sec.&nbsp;at the upper thigh. The respiratory belt transducer senses stretch and can be used to measure <strong>calf volume</strong> (Figure&nbsp;4) <strong>before</strong>, <strong>during inflation</strong>, and <strong>after deflating</strong> the cuff (recovery).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Record the subject’s <strong>resting</strong> recording for 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Rapidly <strong>Inflate</strong> the cuff to <strong>60 mmHg</strong> (or whatever pressure feels tight enough to restrict blood flow for the subject [I used 80 mmHg], the pressure should be same for all measurements),</li>
<li><strong>Hold pressure</strong> for <strong>exactly 20 seconds</strong> (<em>NOTE: You may have to gently squeeze the bulb to keep pressure constant.</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Quickly and COMPLETELY release</strong> the pressure (Figure&nbsp;5).</li>

<p>The simulated dive involves multiple stimuli simultaneously. <strong>Brainstorm</strong> how you might <em>identify the components which are actually “triggering” the dive response by isolating stimuli.</em> Are these components all necessary? Are they additive?</p>
<p>Each group should <strong>design and perform an experiment to isolate one potential stimulus</strong> responsible for triggering the dive response. Get your idea approved by your TA.

<p><em>Distance from heart</em> – “We demonstrate the predicted drop in blood pressure with distance from the central pump. We explore whether there is a greater drop in systolic or diastolic pressure with distance” (in a full lab report you would set up your ideas for why it might go either way).</p>
<p><em>Effect of gravity</em> – “We demonstrate the action of gravity on blood pressure. As vertebrates possess a closed circulatory system, vertical height should contribute to blood pressure in predictable ways.”</p>
<p><em>Dive response</em> – “When diving, peripheral circulation should be reorganized to reduce cardiac output and increase peripheral vasoconstriction, called the dive response. We aim to observe the dive response by measuring ________________________.”</p>
<p><em>Stimulus for dive response</em> – “We will test potential triggers for the dive response including ____________________________.””</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bring-with-you">Bring with you:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your lab notebook</li>
<li>A timing device (e.g.&nbsp;your phone)</li>
<li>Sun screen, hat, and sunglasses. It will be hot and sunny!</li>
<li>Water</li>
</ul>
<p>Your task this week is to construct an energy budget for an animal of your choice, very similar to modeling the metabolism of your fossil. Each group will choose a different zoo animal (Letʻs try to spread the groups across the large /small, herbivore/predator combinations).</p>

<h1>Focal Observation</h1>
<p>As a group choose an animal to observe.</p>
<section id="collect-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="collect-data">Collect Data:</h2>
<p><strong>Mass:</strong> Approximate the dimensions of your animal. Approximate the volume of your animal, by whatever geometric approximation seems reasonable to you. Animals are ~70% water. Estimate mass from the density of water (1g/cm^3).</p>
<p>FYI: Volume of a cylinder: V = π<em>r2</em>length (use metric units!!)</p>
<p><strong>Behavior:</strong> (focus on intensity of effort and time budget)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>15 min observation focal observation</li>
</ol>
<p>Each group member will collect a 15 min focal observation. Record in your notebook everything your animal does during the 15 min observation period, recording activity and duration.</p>
<p>For example: + Lying on ground 10 min (can add comments or social context, etc.) + Walking slowly 1 min + Etc.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Also record general info: species, male/female/adult/juvenile etc., time of day, habitat and surroundings, any conspecifics nearby?</li>
<li>After your focal observation, write some general impressions. How would you characterize your animalʻs behavior? What seems to be motivating your animal? (note anything relevant, like keeps looking toward a male, trying to reach food, etc.).<br>
</li>
<li>Note any behaviors related to temperature exchange: Basking? Seeking shade? Pressing their body against a cool surface (conduction)? Enjoying strong wind (convection)? Wet? Etc.</li>
<li>Take photos and videos that capture the essence of your animal or show something interesting.</li>
<li>Optional: Your animal may or may not do very much during your observation period. You can also take “scan samples” periodically. Say every hour or half hour, what is your animal doing? Who is nearby?</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis"><strong>Analysis:</strong></h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Construct a mass model for your animal.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>BMR</strong> or <strong>SMR</strong>. Choose an appropriate scaling equation for BMR or SMR from Withers 1991 Table 4-5 and calculate the lowest metabolic rate for your animal. If an ectotherm, guestimate what the animal’s Tb is.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Time Budget:</strong> Analyze your focal observation and use it to estimate a time budget. With your team members, decide on the intensity levels of each type of behavior. Based on your own experience, assign effort levels to each type of behavior. (divide activities into say, 3 categories of effort). Estimate the percent of time spent in each category based on your observation and other information you may know.</li>
<li>Use Table 4-10 to select appropriate activity multipliers for each category. For example, RMR might be 1.2x BMR based on … in Table 4-10. In general, very inactive animals will have a lower RMR (say 1.1. Or 1.2x BMR) than very active animals (say 1.5 x BMR).<br>
</li>
<li><strong>DMR:</strong> Take an educated guess about how many hours your animal spends sleeping or resting, and in each of your active categories. Construct a model for the cost of 1 day. We call this DMR or daily metabolic rate. For example, your animalʻs DMR might be = 16 hrs x RMR + 1 hr x AMR(activity 1) + 7hr x AMR(activity 2). Etc.</li>

</section>
<section id="report" class="level1">
<h1><strong>Report:</strong></h1>
<p>Your assignment is to write a group short lab report with the following sections:</p>
<p><em>Intro:</em></p>
<p>Write a short paragraph describing your animal. What do you think the relevant background should include? End with a statement of purpose.</p>
<p><em>Methods (~2-3 concise paragraphs):</em></p>
<ul>
<li>State how you collected your data. “Focal observations were conducted… “<br>
</li>
<li>State what you modeled. For each model, explain how you calculated it. Remember, you are making it up so you have to explain your logic so that someone outside the class could understand. Include your equations and all the assumptions or estimations you used to model mass, BMR/SMR, one or more AMRs, and DMR.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Results (probably ~1-2 paragraphs, grouped by topic):</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What did your animal do? What was itʻs primary activity? Look at your results and think about how best to convey the main findings. A table of activities and time? Or perhaps grouped into resting, low intensity, high intensity activities? You decide.<br>
</li>
<li>Report your mass, and all MRʻs. Also report mass-specific BMR and DMR.<br>
</li>
<li>Notes on the observed behavior of the animal.<br>
</li>
<li>Include photos or video clips to help tell the story of your animal.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Discussion (1 or more paragraphs, depending on how much you have to say - no fluff!):</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A small discussion that sheds light on your findings. All in all, how would you characterize your animal? Is it an active animal or a sedentary animal?<br>
</li>
<li>Any insight into what guides its energy consumption? Based on your observations, what did itʻs main concern seem to be? Here is a good place to add in some of your observations to back up your characterization. The discussion is where you can speculate a little about what your data might mean.<br>
</li>
<li>Comment on any temperature-regulation behaviors.<br>
</li>
<li>Conclusion: What do your findings imply? Do you understand more about your animal? Does it make sense, given that itʻs a large/small predator/herbivore, etc. What could be some fruitful next steps if you were to continue the research? (do you think the behavior of your animal would be different in the wild?, etc. )</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Respective Contributions:</em> Each lab group member is expected to participate meaningfully in data collection, data analysis, lab report writing, and lab report editing. Please identify a project coordinator for this lab.</p>
<section id="submit" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="submit">Submit:</h2>
<p>Write up your short group lab report and include photos and links to videos that you took. If you provide a link to a video on your google drive, be sure to make it public so we can see it. Include your group member names in the report.</p>
<p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Clarity of ideas is highly prized in science, which is more obvious when you are concise. Do include any relevant scientific terms (BMR, DMR, etc.), but other than that, use plain, direct language that gets straight to the point and your writing will be stronger.</p>

  <title>Lab Notebooks and Prelab Instructions</title>
  <link>https://mbutler808.github.io/labs/Lab-notebooks/lab-notebook.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>Your <strong>lab notebook</strong> is a record of your labwork. In research, a lab notebook is more than a diary of your work, it is used to write your reports and papers, inspire future research, or even prove the development of ideas in court cases.</p>
<p>For this class, it is bound notebook used exclusively for recording information and notes pertinent to experiments performed in this lab. Your lab notebook will help you to do well on your lab reports, which are typed (i.e., mini scientific papers) that you turn in for grading. It is also a great place to take notes in lab lectures or discussion that may be helpful later.</p>
<section id="format" class="level1">
<h1>Format</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title page</strong>
<ul>
<li>Include your name, email address, lab section and purpose of the notebook on the first page, and the names and contact information (email and phone #) for your lab group.</li>
<li><strong>Table of contents</strong>: update weekly with page numbers for each lab. (Number the pages of the rest of your lab notebook).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Labs</strong> - Each lab has four sections:
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong> <em>(prelab)</em></li>
<li><strong>Methods</strong> <em>(prelab)</em></li>
<li><strong>Results</strong> <em>(in lab)</em></li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong> <em>(in lab)</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="sec-prelab" class="level1">
<h1>Prelab</h1>
<p><strong>At home</strong>, read through the complete lab exercise. Your lab may also have standard protocols to read. In your notebook, write (or bullet-point) the introduction and methods sections below. This is your pre-lab assignment (5pts), and will be checked by your TA at the start of lab.</p>
<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write the purpose of the week’s experiment. This should be the general idea that is broad enough to cover all of the ideas in the lab (the “umbrella idea”).</li>
<li>Bullet-point the most relevant background in this experiment, and how it might connect to a hypothesis.</li>
<li>Introduce the physiological mechanisms under study</li>
<li>Start from what we know about the topic, and connect to what we are trying to demonstrate or find out in the current experiment.</li>
<li>Be sure to introduce any ideas that go into your hypothesis.</li>
<li>In other words, try to foreshadow why the current experiment is important.</li>
<li>A starting hypothesis (or hypotheses if there are multiple parts).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>An introduction just introduces the ideas (or touches upon them). Just enough so we can understand the hypothesis.</em></p>
<p>Your TA will give you feedback during the prelab-check. <em>We particularly want to make sure you have a strong hypothesis.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="methods" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methods">Methods</h2>
<p>The experiment should be reproducible by a scientist based on your methods. Include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type of subjects (species) and how many</li>
<li>What measurements you collected</li>
<li>Techniques. (e.g., Human heart rate (HR) was measured using a finger pulse transducer connected to a PowerLab Data Acquistion System). Note settings.</li>
<li>Experimental details.
<ul>
<li>Measurements (what?, where?, recording for how long, how many times, etc.)</li>
<li>Details of controls (or baselines) and treatments</li>
<li>Order of experiments, etc.</li>
<li>You do not need to copy standard protocols. Simply refer to any published or standard protocols (i.e, from lab manual), but explain any customizations. Do explain what the standard protocols were used to measure.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How raw data are converted to physiological measurements
<ul>
<li>For example, “systolic pressure was obtained from the blood pressure waveform by taking peak-to-trough measurements of the largest peaks.”</li>
<li>Example: “Heart rate was calculated using the cyclic measurements panel in LabChart softare to measure the time between pulse wave peaks (peak-to-peak measurements) divided by elapsed time.”</li>
<li>Example: “Peripheral circulation volume was measured as the difference between maximum and minimum leg volume measurements (at baseline and after reducing venous return for 30sec, respectively).”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Analysis
<ul>
<li>How the data will be used to evaluate the hypotheses. In other words, what will we compare to know whether the hypothesis has any support? This usually involves how the treatments will be compared to controls or baseline and can foreshadow the figures presented in the results.</li>
<li>For example, “HR was compared before and during a simulated dive to assess diving bradycardia, and venous pooling …”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="in-lab" class="level1">
<h1>In Lab</h1>
<section id="results" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Include raw data, calculations, equations, and physiological parameters obtained in your notebook.</p>
<ul>
<li>Write all raw results in your notebook obtained from measuring peaks or landmarks, etc.</li>
<li>If your lab manual has any tables, you can fill them in and paste them into your notebook.</li>
<li>Data from the Chart software can be saved as .adicht (Windows chart data), which is a text format. This can be further analyzed at home with LabChart reader 8.0 software.</li>
<li>It is important to record things that go wrong as well as things that go right.</li>
<li>We will have in-lab discussions about how to analyze data and brainstorm what effective figures might look like. It is a great idea to sketch these ideas in your notebook.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>During lab, there should be time to collect the physiological parameters from your raw data, and to play with making figures or tables for your lab report.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="discussion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Summarize your conclusions from the experiment. Discuss what your results mean and interpret in light of the purpose of the lab. Think about what it implications your results might have more broadly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Look through your results and at least bullet-point some potential discussion topics.<br>
</li>
<li>Focus on interpretation of your direct results</li>
<li>What do your results mean? Dig into the details of the results.</li>
<li>Note any connections between your results and known physiological mechanisms. What have we learned or demonstrated?</li>
<li>Could your results apply to anything else? End by broadening out.</li>
<li>Include any good ideas that come up during the lab session.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="checkout" class="level1">
<h1>Checkout</h1>
<p>Before you leave the lab, checkout with your TA.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your TA will give you feedback on your results and discussion, and your hypothesis (which hopefully has been improved).<br>
</li>
<li>Our goal is to ensure you leave lab with all the materials needed to write an excellent report.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: If you have a good lab notebook, it will be easy to write your lab report because most of it can be taken from your notebook!</em></p>

    "text": "Subject preparation\n\nMake sure the PowerLab is turned off and the USB cable is connected to the computer.\nConnect the 5 Lead Shielded Bio Amp Cable to the Bio Amp Connector on the front panel of the PowerLab (Figure 2). The hardware needs to be connected before you open the settings file.\nAttach the leads of the EEG Flat Electrodes to the Earth, CH1 NEG and POS pins closest to the labeled side on the Bio Amp Cable. Channel 1 “positive” will lead to the inion (the bump on the back of the head above the neck) and Channel 1 “negative” will lead to the forehead. Channel 2 will be empty and the Earth will lead to the temple. Refer to Figure 1 for proper placement, but do not attach them to the volunteer. Follow the color scheme on the Bio Amp Cable.\nRemove any jewelry from the volunteer’s face, ears, and neck. Use a ballpoint pen to mark a small cross on the skin on the back of the head, forehead, and temple. Use Figure 1 as a guide. Abrade the skin with Abrasive Gel or Pad. This is important as abrasion helps reduce the skin’s resistance.\nAfter abrasion, clean the area with an alcohol swab to remove the dead skin cells. While the skin is drying, scoop Electrode Paste into the EEG Flat Electrodes. When the skin is dry stick the electrodes to the skin (Figure 2) and keep the electrodes and wires in place with the medical tape. Use the ACE bandage to wrap keep the flat electrodes tightly in contact with the head. This will help the electrodes maintain good contact with the skin.\nHave the volunteer seated in a comfortable position at the table with paper and pen and a laptop in front of them. During the experiment is important to minimize muscle movement and ensure that none of the electrodes are disturbed or compressed.\nCheck that all five electrodes are properly connected to the volunteer and the Bio Amp Cable before proceeding. Turn on the PowerLab. (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Electrodes and cable setup. We will use five electrodes to record from two channels and a ground. Follow instructions provided by your TA for electrode placement."

Three channels should appear: the EEG frontal and the EEG occipital, and two channels: Alpha power frontal and Alpha power occipital.\nMake sure that the EEG channels are set to the “Bioamp”. Make sure the settings are as follows: Range 200 \\(\\mu\\)V, High Pass 0.5 Hz, and Low Pass 50 Hz (Figure 3). Check that the spectral input is reading the channels for the EEG. You may have to change the inputs to match the correct channel number. If you are using the new setup, you may have to change and restart Chart (several times) with the Bioamp cable connected for it to appear in the menu. If you are using the old setup, the little green light on the front of the Bioamp should be on. Ask your TA for help if needed.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Check your recording and filter settings in the Bioamp dialog box."

True EEG signals rarely exceed these limits.\nExamine the entire data trace and Autoscale, if necessary. There may be some large signals outside the ±75 µV range. Such large signals are artifacts."

    "text": "Analysis: Alpha Waves in the EEG\n\nExamine the entire data trace. Use the View Buttons to change the horizontal compression to see data with eyes open and shut. Make a data selection that includes some data from both eyes open and eyes shut conditions. View this selection in Zoom View. This should make it easier to see the alpha wave activity (Figure 4). Now Autoscale, if necessary.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: EEG signal with eyes shut and open. Note alpha waves during eyes shut.\n\n\n\nIn Chart View scroll through the “eyes shut” recording to look for alpha waves. Use the View Buttons to change the horizontal compression if necessary. The alpha waves can be recognized by their amplitude (usually 30 to 50 \\(\\mu\\)V peak-to-peak, although it can be quite variable) and their frequency. Each cycle of an alpha wave should last approximately 0.1 s.\n\nNote: If you cannot find brain activity that matches the alpha rhythm, re-attach the electrodes and repeat this exercise.\n\nUse the Marker and Waveform Cursor to measure the amplitude of the alpha waves. Place the Marker at the lowest point of the wave and move the Waveform Cursor to the peak of the wave. Measure the amplitudes of five waves from when the volunteer’s eyes were closed. Record the values in Table 1.\nNow measure wave amplitudes when the volunteer’s eyes were open. Record these values in Table 2 .\nThe amplitude of the waves is affected by the quality of the EEG signal. Therefore, it is useful to examine the frequency and power of the wave activity. Spectral analysis can be used to examine these features of a signal. Before examining your EEG signal you will complete a short tutorial on Spectral Analysis.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Alpha waves\n\n\n\nAmplitude\n\n\n\n\nWave 1\n\n\n\nWave 2\n\n\n\nWave 3\n\n\n\nWave 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Absence of alpha waves\n\n\n\nAmplitude\n\n\n\n\nWave 1\n\n\n\nWave 2\n\n\n\nWave 3\n\n\n\nWave 4"

What are the rough rules of thumb for how much higher RMR, AMR, and MMR are above BMR or SMR for active endotherms vs ectotherms? (Look in Withers).

What is the justification?\n\n\n\n\nTable 4-10 from Withers 1992\n\n\n\nWhat is direct and indirect calorimetry? Why can we metabolism by measuring an animal’s heat production (think thermodynamics)?

You will want to cover relevant questions such as:\n\nWhat kind of animal was it? What did it look like? (Please draw the figures yourself, it is part of the learning process).\n\nInclude any info that you find particularly interesting about the animal.\nWhere did it live? General environment? (think metabolism and heat balance, so climate, humidity, temperature.\nWhat was the range of ambient temperatures in which it lived, etc.)\n\nDid it seek cover for shade or hiding places (think how it might impact heat balance and activity)?\nWas it an active animal? How did it obtain food?\n\nWhat other sorts of animals and plants lived at the same time?\n\nFor the sake of completeness, please organize your info into categories such as\n\ngeneral morphology and physical description,\nphylogeny and closest living relatives,\ntime period and range,\nhabitat, climate, and thermal biology,\nlifestyle and behavior (such as foraging mode, locomotor strategy, social behavior, etc.)\n\nStart with your Library Books, but continue the search using journal articles, online reviews, and books borrowed through interlibrary loan.

We will learn physiology and apply our skills to reconstructing the physiological systems of an extinct animal. The lab allows students to see physiology in action in live-animal experiments illustrating heart regulation, muscle contraction, nerve conduction, and kidney function.\nThroughout the course we will develop:\n- Individual skills in finding and close reading of scientific literature, synthesis of information, presentation in oral and written forms.\n- Collaboration skills in discussion, brainstorming, project organization and management, and collaborative writing.\n- Practical skills in dissection, specimen preparation, troubleshooting instrumentation, data analysis, figure design.\nWe will cover metabolism and scaling, heat balance, the circulatory system, feeding and digetsion, neurons and signal propagation, sensory biology, muscles and motor control, biomechanics and locomotion, blood, ventilation and respiration, osmoregulation and excretion, hormonal control, reproduction, and the immune system."

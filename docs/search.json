We will learn physiology and apply our skills to reconstructing the physiological systems of an extinct animal. The lab allows students to see physiology in action in live-animal experiments illustrating heart regulation, muscle contraction, nerve conduction, and kidney function.\nThroughout the course we will develop:\n- Individual skills in finding and close reading of scientific literature, synthesis of information, presentation in oral and written forms.\n- Collaboration skills in discussion, brainstorming, project organization and management, and collaborative writing.\n- Practical skills in dissection, specimen preparation, troubleshooting instrumentation, data analysis, figure design.\nWe will cover metabolism and scaling, heat balance, the circulatory system, feeding and digetsion, neurons and signal propagation, sensory biology, muscles and motor control, biomechanics and locomotion, blood, ventilation and respiration, osmoregulation and excretion, hormonal control, reproduction, and the immune system."

You can determine what version of R you have by starting up R and typing into the console R.version.string and hitting the return/enter key. If you do not have the proper version of R installed, go to CRAN and download and install the latest version.\nSome students like to use the Rstudio interface, but this is optional. The RStudio interactive development environment (IDE) requires that R be installed, and so is an “add-on” to R. You can obtain the RStudio Desktop for free from the RStudio web site. You can determine the version of RStudio by looking at menu item Help &gt; About RStudio. You should be using RStudio version 1.4.1106 or higher."

This is entirely left up to the discretion of the student.\nLate days are intended to give you flexibility: you can use them for any reason no questions asked.\nYou do not get any bonus points for not using your late days, and they are not transferrable.\n\nFor students who exceed their free late days:\n\nI will be deducting 5% for each extra late day. For example, if you have already used all of your late days for the term, we will deduct 5% for the assignment that is &lt;24 hours late, 10% points for the assignment that is 24-48 hours late, and 15% points for the assignment that is 48-72 hours late, etc.\nI will not grade assignments that are more than 3 days past the original due date.\n\n\nRegrading Policy\nIt is very important to me that all assignments are properly graded. If you believe there is an error in your assignment grading, please send an email within 7 days of receiving the grade explaining the issue. No re-grade requests will be accepted orally, and no regrade requests will be accepted more than 7 days after you receive the grade for the assignment."

While we encourage you to discuss strategies for problem solving, and even collaborate by working through the problems/strategies together, giving someone all the answers is cheating. If you are unsure please ask.\nPlagiarism is when you use information or present ideas, whether by paraphrase or direct quote, from a source (be it published or a classmate) without giving proper credit to that source. Cheating in any way will be reported to the attention of UH Office of Judicial Affairs, and result in an F in this course. Students should be familiar with the policies and procedures specified under the Systemwide Student Conduct Code portal."

I will not discuss the mathematical details of specific data analysis approaches, however some statistical background and being comfortable with quantitative thinking is useful. Previous experience with writing computer programs in general and R in particular is also helpful, but not necessary. If you have no programming experience, expect to spend extra time getting yourself familiar with R. As long as you are willing to invest the time to learn the programming and you do not mind thinking quantitatively, you should be able to take the course, independent of your background.\n\nGetting set up\nYou must install R and RStudio on your computer in order to complete this course. These are two different applications that must be installed separately before they can be used together:\n\nR is the core underlying programming language and computing engine that we will be learning in this course\nRStudio is an interface into R that makes many aspects of using and programming R simpler\n\nBoth R and RStudio are available for Windows, macOS, and most flavors of Unix and Linux. Please download the version that is suitable for your computing setup.\nThroughout the course, we will make use of numerous R add-on packages that must be installed over the Internet. Packages can be installed using the install.packages() function in R. For example, to install the tidyverse package, you can run\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nin the R console.\n\nHow to Download R for Windows\nGo to https://cran.r-project.org and\n\nClick the link to “Download R for Windows”\nClick on “base”\nClick on “Download R 4.2.1 for Windows”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nFor all software, please download the latest version.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Download R for the Mac\nGoto https://cran.r-project.org and\n\nClick the link to “Download R for (Mac) OS X”.\nClick on “R-4.2.1.pkg” (or the latest version)\n\n\n\nHow to Download RStudio\nGoto https://rstudio.com and\n\nClick on “Products” in the top menu\nThen click on “RStudio” in the drop down menu\nClick on “RStudio Desktop”\nClick the button that says “DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP”\nClick the button under “RStudio Desktop” Free\nUnder the section “All Installers” choose the file that is appropriate for your operating system."

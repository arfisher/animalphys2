Each personʻs discussion grade is averaged from their partners. Failure to attend = zero grade discussion grade. Teaching staff can override grades for poor contribution at our discretion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccessful discussion requires a respectful attitude and collaborative behavior.\n\n\n\n\nParticipation means Everyone must speak; everyone must listen\n\nTake turns before diving deeper\nListen before contributing again\nTake the time to make everyone feel comfortable\n\nEncourage participation from all — if someone is quiet, ask for their input/thoughts\nRespect cultural differences, do not judge people based on communication style\nDiscussions are not about “scoring points” — they are about going deeper and getting creative."

On paper or by tablet is OK. - Come for help if you are stuck. - You may collaborate by working together — you may discuss strategies for solving the problems. DO NOT ASK FOR OR GIVE OUT THE WORKED OUT ANSWER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. - Cheating or abuse of the honor system will result in big changes in the course and reporting to the Office of Judicial Affairs."

    "text": "Suggestions for Metabolism and Heat Balance Design\nLook through the analysis below and find the information needed to model your animalʻs metabolism and heat balance. Hopefully you have it in your background bullet points. Become the expert: find EVERYTHING about your species in the literature, and use the web and library to fill any holes. Ask us or the science librarians for help ASAP. For example: What kind of animal was it? What did it look like? (Please draw the figures yourself, it is part of the learning process). Its position in the tree of life? Where/when did it live? General environment (think metabolism and heat balance, so climate, humidity, range of ambient temperature, etc.) What other sorts of animals and plants lived at the same time? Was it an active animal? How did it obtain food? Did it seek cover for shade or hiding places from predators (think how it might impact heat balance and activity)? You want to foreshadow (i.e., hint at) any potential challenges with regard to heat balance (or maybe life was easy in every situation)? Include any info that you find particularly interesting about the animal.\nAnalysis: Complete the analysis below using assumptions appropriate for your animal (see sample calculations). Type it up as an appendix of calculations. Both partners must contribute substantively to finding info and analysis.\nFirst draft (due 9/25 by 5pm): Include an outline of the intro (organized bullet points of factual information that describes your animal and its metabolism and heat balance problem for a scientific paper), and a complete analysis (appendix). Also include a first draft of the paper. I highly recommend that you first make an outline – and after completing the full analysis, you write the results and methods, then the discussion, then the intro. Prioritize finishing the analysis, then outline/bullet point your ideas for the discussion and intro, and draft as much as you can. Give us as much as you can so we can give feedback. Add citations as you go.\nFinal draft (due 10/2): Will include an introduction, methods, results, discussion, literature cited, appendix, and respective contributions.\nNote: You are writing a scientific paper (like a scientific journal article — not Q&A). Below are content suggestions to help you write an excellent paper (only include aspects that are relevant to your animal):\n\nRequired: From fossils described in the literature, estimate the body mass and body dimensions of your animal. Make a sketch of your animal and add the body dimensions (overall height, leg length, wing span, etc).\nWas your animal poikilothermic or homeothermic? Endothermic or ectothermic? What range of body temperatures could your animal tolerate? How did it deal with extreme heat or cold stress? If the animal was a thermoregulator, how did it regulate its body temperature? Did it have insulating fur, feathers or fat? Could it sweat or use other forms of evaporative cooling? Did it allow its tissues to become supercooled without freezing? Was it freeze tolerant? Did it use countercurrent heat exchangers? Did it go into torpor or hibernate?\nFor endotherms, calculate BMR (choose an appropriate interspecific scaling equation from Withers Table 4-5). From BMR, estimate RMR, AMR, MMR and DMR. What is the metabolic scope of your animal? Include a lot of detail in writing about the lifestyle of the animal and why you chose the values that you did to estimate DMR and MMR.\nFor ectotherms, choose an appropriate interspecific scaling equation from Withers Table 4-5 and the iterative method to calculate SMR for the animal when it is inactive at night (assume a Q\\(_{10}\\) of 2.5 for metabolic rate). How much higher is body temperature than air temperature during the night (T\\(_b\\)-T\\(_a\\))? Use the Q\\(_{10}\\) correction to calculate SMR at the higher ambient temperatures during the day (not yet iterative). Increase SMR by a factor of 1.5-3 to reflect active metabolic rate (AMR). Now use the iterative calculations to determine Tb-Ta, and the corresponding increase in MR. Estimate DMR for your animal. These are just suggestions, find something interesting about DMR to explore.\nEstimate values for the heat balance equation for your animal at rest. Use allometric equations to estimate minimum Hc, and CEWL+REWL to estimate minimum He. Then imagine some situations in which your animal might experience heat or cold stress, and use the heat equation to see whether it is able to maintain heat balance. Create a situation that would put your animal out of heat balance. How fast does the body temperature increase or decrease?\nIf your animal is an endotherm, how much energy per day could your animal save by hibernating with a lower body temperature (if reasonable for your animal; this is a hard question to answer).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Use standard scientific citation and reference formats throughout all of your papers.\n\n\n\nCite sources as (author(s), date) and include full references at the end of each design. For example: The earliest amphibians were largely aquatic, and are thought to have had internal gills (Coates and Clack, 1991).\nCoates, M. I. and Clack, J. A. 1991. Fish-like gills and breathing in the earliest known tetrapod. Nature, 352:234-236.\n\n\n[pdf] version of this sheet"

If an ectotherm, guestimate what the animal’s Tb is.\n\nTime Budget: Analyze your focal observation and use it to estimate a time budget. With your team members, decide on the intensity levels of each type of behavior. Based on your own experience, assign effort levels to each type of behavior. (divide activities into say, 3 categories of effort). Estimate the percent of time spent in each category based on your observation and other information you may know.\nUse Table 4-10 to select appropriate activity multipliers for each category. For example, RMR might be 1.2x BMR based on … in Table 4-10. In general, very inactive animals will have a lower RMR (say 1.1. Or 1.2x BMR) than very active animals (say 1.5 x BMR).\n\nDMR: Take an educated guess about how many hours your animal spends sleeping or resting, and in each of your active categories. Construct a model for the cost of 1 day. We call this DMR or daily metabolic rate. For example, your animalʻs DMR might be = 16 hrs x RMR + 1 hr x AMR(activity 1) + 7hr x AMR(activity 2).

    "text": "A. Set up and testing\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Attachment of the respiratory belt transducer to the calf for leg volume measurement.\n\n\n\nSwitch the PowerLab to the Dive Response settings. You should have the Finger Pulse transducer in channel 1 and the Respiratory Belt Transducer to input 2 to measure leg volume. Check the channel settings to make sure they match the inputs. Ask your TA for the proper settings. In this experiment, the sphygnamanometer is used to pressurize the thigh and not plugged in to PowerLab.\nSet up and maintain a wash basin with icewater deep enough to submerge your face up to your temples. Use a thermometer to monitor temperature at 10-15C (50-60F), replenish with ice as needed.\nAttach the respiratory belt snugly to the calf (Figure 4). It should feel tight and the sensor fabric should be slightly stretched.\nPlace the sphygnomanometer cuff around the subject’s thigh, and duct tape it securely so that it can be pressurized to restrict blood flow. Be sure to apply tape to secure both the top and the bottom of the cuff.\nRecord for 10 seconds and stop. Scale the Pulse channel and the Leg Volume channel to fully display the data.\nRecord again and test by flexing and relaxing your calf. You should be able to see a clear deflection on the leg volume channel. If it is very small, try tightening the respiratory belt a little. Check with your TA before moving on.\nFor all experiments, resting position for the subject is leaning over the basin with the face just aboe water.\nUse a timer to time the treatments (a cell phone or a web browser will do).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea behind measuring peripheral circulation using leg volume changes\n\n\n\nWe can quantify the volume in your peripheral circulation (specifically your lower leg) by assessing venous pooling for a standard time interval. By constricting blood flow to the lower limb, we will prevent venous return of the blood. Because the veins have little smooth muscle, it is relatively easy to stop venous return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtocol: Basic Leg volume measurement\n\n\n\nYou will use the sphygnomanometer cuff to cut off circulation in the leg for 20 sec. at the upper thigh. The respiratory belt transducer senses stretch and can be used to measure calf volume (Figure 4) before, during inflation, and after deflating the cuff (recovery).\n\nRecord the subject’s resting recording for 10 seconds.\nRapidly Inflate the cuff to 60 mmHg (or whatever pressure feels tight enough to restrict blood flow for the subject [I used 80 mmHg], the pressure should be same for all measurements),\nHold pressure for exactly 20 seconds (NOTE: You may have to gently squeeze the bulb to keep pressure constant.)\nQuickly and COMPLETELY release the pressure (Figure 5).\nRecovery: Record for 30 sec or until the leg volume returns to baseline.\n\n\nNOTES:\n\nComments should be placed at the start of rest and at the start of each change in condition.\nBe sure to have the comments pre-typed in the comment box and hit enter at the start of each event to accurately place comments in time.\nInflate and deflate the cuff as fast as possible.\nWhen doing repeated measurements, ensure you have baseline data for at least 15 sec before inflating the cuff again.\nThe subject will have to hold their breath for about 30 sec. \nMake good comments and minimize movement in the Finger Pulse Transducer."

What are the rough rules of thumb for how much higher RMR, AMR, and MMR are above BMR or SMR for active endotherms vs ectotherms? (Look in Withers).

What is the justification?\n\n\n\n\nTable 4-10 from Withers 1992\n\n\n\nWhat is direct and indirect calorimetry? Why can we metabolism by measuring an animal’s heat production (think thermodynamics)?

Help them get a better grade by being clear so that the final version can be as strong as possible.\nYour peer-review grade (10 pts) will be based on the quality of your critique, including the reasonableness of the grade you assign.\n\nBring three copies of your written review with you to lab (one for me and one for each author), and the marked up manuscript for the authors.\n\nAsk any questions on Discord."

We will learn physiology and apply our skills to reconstructing the physiological systems of an extinct animal. The lab allows students to see physiology in action in live-animal experiments illustrating heart regulation, muscle contraction, nerve conduction, and kidney function.\nThroughout the course we will develop:\n- Individual skills in finding and close reading of scientific literature, synthesis of information, presentation in oral and written forms.\n- Collaboration skills in discussion, brainstorming, project organization and management, and collaborative writing.\n- Practical skills in dissection, specimen preparation, troubleshooting instrumentation, data analysis, figure design.\nWe will cover metabolism and scaling, heat balance, the circulatory system, feeding and digetsion, neurons and signal propagation, sensory biology, muscles and motor control, biomechanics and locomotion, blood, ventilation and respiration, osmoregulation and excretion, hormonal control, reproduction, and the immune system."

Just enough so we can understand the hypothesis.\nYour TA will give you feedback during the prelab-check. We particularly want to make sure you have a strong hypothesis."

Note settings.\nExperimental details.\n\nMeasurements (what?, where?, recording for how long, how many times, etc.)\nDetails of controls (or baselines) and treatments\nOrder of experiments, etc.\nYou do not need to copy standard protocols. Simply refer to any published or standard protocols (i.e, from lab manual), but explain any customizations. Do explain what the standard protocols were used to measure.\n\nHow raw data are converted to physiological measurements\n\nFor example, “systolic pressure was obtained from the blood pressure waveform by taking peak-to-trough measurements of the largest peaks.”\nExample: “Heart rate was calculated using the cyclic measurements panel in LabChart softare to measure the time between pulse wave peaks (peak-to-peak measurements) divided by elapsed time.”\nExample: “Peripheral circulation volume was measured as the difference between maximum and minimum leg volume measurements (at baseline and after reducing venous return for 30sec, respectively).”\n\nAnalysis\n\nHow the data will be used to evaluate the hypotheses. In other words, what will we compare to know whether the hypothesis has any support? This usually involves how the treatments will be compared to controls or baseline and can foreshadow the figures presented in the results.\nFor example, “HR was compared before and during a simulated dive to assess diving bradycardia, and venous pooling …”"

This can be further analyzed at home with LabChart reader 8.0 software.\nIt is important to record things that go wrong as well as things that go right.\nWe will have in-lab discussions about how to analyze data and brainstorm what effective figures might look like. It is a great idea to sketch these ideas in your notebook.\n\nDuring lab, there should be time to collect the physiological parameters from your raw data, and to play with making figures or tables for your lab report."

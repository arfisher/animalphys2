## In Lab: 

- Peripheral circulation experiment
  + Develop a simple experiment to demonstrate a principle of peripheral circulation of choice.
- Dive response experiment 
  + Develop a hypothesis for a potential trigger for the dive response.


## After Lab: Assignment Week 3:

- Individual WorkSheet \[[html](Lab3ws.qmd)\]
- Reminder: _Practical next week (week 4) on Lab 1 material_.  Let us know if you want to come in to practice.
